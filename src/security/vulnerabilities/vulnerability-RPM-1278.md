## Vulnerability details

The vulnerability details are available at [CVE-2021-22116](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22116) and [CVE-2021-22117](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22117).

## Workarounds

All workarounds are highly infrastructure dependent, for which we recommend hardening of:

* RabbitMQ installation folder permissions.
* Network access. Based on the [OutSystems network requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_network_requirements), port 5672 must only be available for access of infrastructure assets. Public access to the given port, or any other port used for the Cache Invalidation Service must be restricted from the Internet.

## Fixed products and versions

OutSystems issued the following releases that address this vulnerability.

* Platform Server 11.13.2

* LifeTime 11.10.4 

We strongly encourage self-managed installations to be updated to the latest version. 

OutSystems Cloud infrastructures aren't affected, due to OutSystems Cloud default infrastructure configurations.
