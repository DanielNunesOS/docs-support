# OS-DP-STREAM-50001

## Error message

`There was an unexpected error on your APM tool server. If the problem persists, contact OutSystems Support.`

## Cause

An unexpected error occurred while connecting your APM tool server.

## Impact

Log streaming cannot connect to the destination server, so logs are not reaching your APM tool.

## Recommended action

In the Log streaming configuration, go back to the **Select destination tool** screen and review the configuration. If the issue persists, create a case with [OutSystems support](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).
