# Access to Online Training when Vimeo is Blocked

The procedure below should only be used in situations where you cannot access the videos directly on the [Training portal](https://www.outsystems.com/training).

By following the procedure below, your progress may not be tracked accurately.

Regarding other types of content such as Quiz and Exercises, you should follow the instructions available on the website.

## Accessing Videos

When you navigate to a video lesson, and if the video platform (e.g. Vimeo) you can download a copy of the video and watch it.
Note that this feature might not be available to all videos.
Contact OutSystems if you need help.

Below the video you have two links, one to download the video (i.e. .mp4), and a second one to download the subtitles (i.e. .srt).

1. Right-click the fisrt link, and select **Save link as**. Select a location/folder in your computer.

1. Repeat the same for the second link.

1. Ensure that both the video file (first link) and the subtitles file (second link) have the same name, and a different extension (e.g. .mp4/.srt).

1. We recommend using [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/) to watch the videos.
