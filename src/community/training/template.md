# This is the page title

This is normal text. You can use links in text. [This is the text that will display in the link](https://www.this-is-the-url.example.com).

## This is a heading 2

Use heading for sections in the article. Don't overuse them, sometimes a list or a separate paragraph is enough.

Leave a space between lines to create a paragraph.

This is a bulleted list, use it to list items that don't have any specific order. Leave a blank line before stating the list:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

This is a numbered list, use it for steps that need to be executed in a specific order:
It may seem strange, but all the steps should be numbered as "1.":

1. Step 1

    You can write further text that belongs to that step. Leave a blank line in between and indent the text that belongs to the step with 4 spaces.

1. Step 2

    These are the instructions for step 2.

1. Step 3

### This is a heading 3

A heading 3 is a "child" of heading 2.

You can also use tables. Here's an example of a simple table that shows the OutSystems tools, and those that use them:

| Tool | Typical users |
| --- | --- |
| Service Studio | Developers |
| LifeTime | DevOps |
| Service Center | Admins and DevOps |
