# Check what your license includes, and your effective usage

The installed license in an environment defines the available features and their limits. To **check the licensing limits** of your environment, go to the **environment management console** at `http://<yourenvironment>/ServiceCenter`. Click the **Administration** tab, and then the **Licensing** submenu.

There you can check:

* The current number of registered users against the maximum allowed;

* The number of Application Objects or Software Units you're using against the maximum allowed;

* And other limits and usage statistics.
