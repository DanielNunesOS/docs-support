# Add a new environment to your infrastructure

To add a new environment to your infrastructure, first contact your sales representative to discuss the requirements for the new environment and the details about obtaining an additional license.

For Cloud or Hybrid customers the new environment will be set up for you, according to your specifications, when the purchase order has been processed.

Hybrid configurations are supported only in **OutSystems** licenses purchased before January 2020.
