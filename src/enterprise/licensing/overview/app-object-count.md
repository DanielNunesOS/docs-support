# Application Object count

This article explains how application objects are counted.

## What are application objects?

Application objects (AO) are elements of your application:

* [**Pages**](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Licensing/Overview/Application_Object_count#What_constitutes_a_page.3F): The screens you design or install in your environment for end users. These can include web screens, email screens, mobile web screens and SMS screens as designed in the visual development environment. For example, a pop-up web screen (Traditional web only) or a Supplier_List web screen each equals 1 application object.

* **Tables**: Entities that you design with OutSystems or import for integration from external databases or both. Each database table in a database equals 1 application object. Each Local Storage entity (applicable to mobile) will count 1 additional AO, regardless if it's a new entity or an existing one.

* [**API/Service operations**](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Licensing/Overview/Application_Object_count#Examples_of_API.2FService_operation_counts): Each method from web services, integration connections, or REST APIs that you [consume](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Extensibility_and_Integration/REST/Consume_REST_APIs) or [expose](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Extensibility_and_Integration/REST/Expose_REST_APIs) count as 1 application object. APIs in extensions, the C# code that you reuse in OutSystems, aren't accounted for.

    **Note**: If any of the above are used more than once across multiple applications, they still only counted as 1 AO.

## What constitutes a page?

**Traditional web apps**: Pages are the web screens, email screens, mobile web screens, SMS screens as designed in the visual development environment. Web blocks aren't pages, but screen components. Therefore theyâ€™re not counted.

**Reactive web apps**: Tabs aren't counted as application objects as they're implemented inside the same screen when using OutSystems UI.

### When a single page includes multiple tabs, what's counted?

If each tab is implemented in a different web screen in the designer, they're different pages and each is an application object. If each tab is implemented on the same screen with web blocks or inline, they all constitute just 1 page or 1 application object.

### What about pop-ups on a single page?

**Traditional web apps**: If the content of the popup is a different web screen, the screen in the popup is counted as a page and therefore is an application object. This is the default when you scaffold a popup or use Richwidgets popup components. 

Usually, a tiny help message won't have its own screen, but will instead be something like a tooltip and therefore isn't counted as an application object. If the popup has some transactional logic, it's usually implemented on a different screen and therefore counts as an application object. The developer will decide the best design.

**Reactive web apps**: Popups aren't counted as application objects as they're implemented inside the same screen when using OutSystems UI.

## Do internal system database tables count towards the application object total?

* In web applications, internal database tables used by OutSystems aren't a part of the application count total when referenced.

* Additionally, in mobile applications, they don't count when referenced in entities. However, if  added to the Local Storage, they count as 1 AO.

* **What constitutes internal system database tables?**

These are the entities listed under the (System) module that you can find while managing dependencies:

## Examples of API/Service operation counts

When consuming [Google Calendar APIs](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/#CalendarList):

* Each method defined there and each method you import to the platform is one API

* Each API counts as 1 application object

For 3 SAP BAPIs consumed via a WebReference or through Platform Connect for SAP:

* Consider these three BAPIs: GetCustomers, CreatePurchaseOrder, GetCustomersPOs

* Each counts as 1 application object for a total of 3

For a CustomerInformation web service with 4 actions:

* SearchCustomers, GetCustomerDetail, CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomerDetail are 4 web service methods exposed to a third party system

* Each equals 1 application object for a total of 4

A REST web reference with 14 methods equals 14 application objects.

## Are there elements that count as two or more application objects?

No, all application elements that contribute to the application object count only count as one AO.  

## Do disabled applications count towards the AO limit?

When an application is **Disabled**, the application objects continue to count towards the overall AOs total of the environment.
