# Change to our email support channel

At OutSystems, we strive to make your interactions with us smooth and frictionless. With this important goal in mind, we're announcing a change to our email support channel.

## What's changing?

We're deactivating the email ticket-creation process through `support@outsystems.com`. To create a support ticket, [call us](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) or create one through the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).

## When does this change take effect?
Effective July 15th, 2021, you can no longer create support tickets by emailing `support@outsystems.com`. Instead, you can create tickets through the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support) or by [phone](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support).

## Why are we doing this?
Creating tickets through the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support) enables us to personalize the support experience to meet your individual needs. Additionally, when you create a ticket, the guided process ensures we have the required information to efficiently route and start troubleshooting your issue. 

## How can I create support tickets?
We encourage you to contact OutSystems Support by [phone](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) or through the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).

## Understood, so what's next?
Until July 15th, 2021, creating a new support ticket by email generates a response that reminds you about the upcoming change. After July 15th, emails no longer create tickets, and you receive an auto-reply that directs you to the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).

Remember, we're always here for you!
