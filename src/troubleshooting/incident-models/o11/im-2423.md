<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>From the Chrome version 119.0.6045.106 - Chromium 119 update (October 31, 2023), Web SQL was deprecated. More context can be found in <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/deprecating-web-sql/">Deprecating and removing Web SQL</a>. This means that Web SQL is deprecated for mobile applications that use local data storage for offline capability.</p>

<p>From OutSystems Platform Version 11.8.0, there is an option in <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/25/factory-configuration">Factory Configuration</a> that allows applications to run with Web SQL:</p>

<ul>
    <li>IndexedDB for Local Storage data on PWAs/browsers</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are getting the error above, it means you disabled this option, which is enabled by default</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<p>In order to solve this issue:</p>

<p>Open the Factory Configuration application in the browser from the affected environments and change the "IndexedDB for Local Storage data on PWAs/Browsers" status on the "Platform Configurations" tab to "Enabled"</p>

<p>Please consider the following screenshot:</p>

<p>![](images/im-image-ck-fafa10d6-bb67-4771-89e6-c8818b4cdeeb.png)</p>

<p>It is possible that a warning pops up stating  "Configuration changes done in FactoryConfiguration might not be applied immediately". In this scenario, we recommend you <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/managing_the_applications_lifecycle/deploy_applications/configure_application_settings_after_deployment/applying_configurations_in_service_center/">create an all content solution and apply the settings</a>, so the configurations take effect.</p>
