<h1>Error sending emails due to exceeding concurrent connections</h1>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Concurrent connections limit exceeded, Error sending email</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<ol>
<li>Check for these errors in Service Center:
<ul>
<li>Error sending email &lt;email id&gt;: <strong>432 4.3.2 Concurrent connections limit exceeded</strong>. Visit <a href="https://aka.ms/concurrent_sending" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aka.ms/concurrent_sending</a> for more information</li>
<li>If you visit the link shown in the error message, there is an explanation for why the error is thrown.  Basically, Microsoft Exchange Online has limitations on the number of concurrent sessions from an application, specifically only 3 concurrent connections are allowed.  This is a strict limitation and cannot be adjusted on the Microsoft side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make note of the number of front-end servers in the affected environment and which ones have emails enabled
<ul>
<li>You can verify this in Service Center &gt; Administration &gt; Servers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check the number of threads allowed for emails
<ul>
<li>If Factory Configuration is installed, log in to Factory Configuration and check the number of threads for emails:
<ul>
<li>Go to the Platform Configurations tab to find it:</li>
<li>![Scheduler configuration screen showing the number of threads for activities, events, and emails, with the number of threads for emails set to 2.](https://supportoutsystems.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ac1QiKCAzwfPbSzkzDAuq8G9L/?name=image.png "Scheduler Configuration in Factory Configuration")</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If Factory Configuration is not installed, please install it from the Forge and then follow the steps above, or if Factory Configuration cannot be installed, check the database for the number of threads:
<ul>
<li>Run this query in the database to find the number of threads for emails:
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>select * from ossys_parameter where name = 'Scheduler.NumberOfThreadsForEmails';</code></p>
 </li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point we should have an understanding of the number of servers that have emails enabled and the number of threads for emails per server</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If the number of servers with emails enabled multiplied by number of threads for emails exceeds 3, then the error is expected to occur</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, if you have 2 front end servers with emails enabled, the maximum number of threads for emails should be 1.  If the maximum threads for emails is set to 2, then 4 simultaneous connections would be possible (2 servers x 2 threads for emails), which exceeds Microsoft's limitation of 3 concurrent connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<ol>
<li>If there are 3 front-end servers with emails enabled or fewer, update the number of threads for emails so that the number of servers with emails enabled multiplied by number of threads for emails is less than or equal to 3:
<ul>
<li>In Factory Configuration:
<ul>
<li>Update the Number of Threads for Emails:
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Click Apply at the bottom of the screen</li>
<li>Restart the Scheduler Service on all front-end servers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or if Factory Configuration is not installed:
<ul>
<li>Run this query in the database:
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>update OSSYS_PARAMETER set VAL = &lt;number of threads&gt; where name = 'Scheduler.NumberOfThreadsForEmails';</code><code class="editorCode">??????</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart the Scheduler Service on all front-end servers</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If more than 3 front-end servers have emails enabled, we can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In Service Center, disable emails on enough front-end servers until the number of servers with emails enabled multiplied by number of threads for emails is less than or equal to 3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on the number of threads for emails, it may also be necessary to follow the steps above to reduce the number of threads for emails</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
