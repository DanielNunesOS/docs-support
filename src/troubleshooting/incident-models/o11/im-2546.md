## Incident Resolution Measures

This error will happen due to the Username claim not being correctly set as the following article shows:

[Configuring LifeTime authentication](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/managing_the_applications_lifecycle/manage_it_users/it_users_integration_with_external_idp_via_openid_connect/configuring_lifetime_authentication/)

![Excerpt from the Configuring LifeTime authentication guide highlighting the note to use 'preferred_username' as the Username Claim value for Azure and Okta.](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uNsKw4cK3ZXlQh8zH7bZhqbtrrRnMo_WaK8kCP9Uj1_3nAq2YnieUFSIJh1nmNrj5AAtWHNA_SsCHt6Gfw_-hQM6PLuUuMecZCFALbwrbbWQkM9R4l_SDc6DyXoH_Dxje1nw6M6qbUUe7mDN7Xyu9ls "Configuring LifeTime authentication guide excerpt")

For Azure and Okta implementations, you will need to use the **preferred_username** claim in the Username Claim section, this way you will be able to proceed with using the desired implementation.

//In this section, not only is the screenshot outdated, since that section is currently with a red warning, but it should mention 'Microsoft Entra' instead of 'Azure'//
