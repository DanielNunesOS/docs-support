<h1>Excel read error</h1>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: error when using excel to record list, Column has an invalid type, excel read error</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2>

<p>No precautions.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>When trying to import data from an Excel table, customers may be faced with the following error in the Service Center:</p>

<code>Excel read error in row 2: Column 'CLOUMN_NAME_XYZ' has an invalid type. Expected a 'TYPE_X' but received a 'TYPE_Y'.
at ssAdministration.Flows.FlowAdministration.ScrnTechnicalAdministration.FuncCommandImportDraftContracts.ExcelToRLExcelToRecordListK9CI6DDklnUKICua2C_wwDg(HeContext heContext, Byte[] excelContent, String tableName, RLContractRecordsRecordList&amp; outParamOut)
at ssAdministration.Flows.FlowAdministration.ScrnTechnicalAdministration.CommandImportDraftContracts(HeContext heContext)</code>

<p><strong>You may refer to below print screen below for an example of such error:</strong></p>

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the error string, this error is thrown when the table and the Excel do not have the same <em>column types </em>as well as the same <em>names</em>. </p>

<p>In sum, when comparing the <strong>'CLOUMN_NAME_XYZ' </strong>from Excel, if one has (<strong>TYPE_X</strong>) while the other has (<strong>TYPE_Y)</strong> it leads to the error about types not matching.</p>

<p>After changing the Excel to match the structure, the error should no longer thrown: </p>

![Notification of a successful import with the message 'Import Started'.](images/im-image-ck-84903a35-50af-4210-84c8-b1e59c6a89ab.png "Successful Import Confirmation")

<p><strong>NOTE. </strong>In order to avoid such an error from happening, you should ensure that the columns have the same type of data between the entity/structure in Service Studio as the Excel spreadsheet that is being imported.</p>
