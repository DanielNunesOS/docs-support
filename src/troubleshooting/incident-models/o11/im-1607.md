# How to confirm if AppShield obfuscation is being correctly applied

**Symptoms**: Mobile application source code is not obfuscated, AppShield obfuscation is not working, Exposed Code

## Precautions

The limitations that are specific to the obfuscation.

- The plugin obfuscates only the supported **OutSystems** mobile plugins.
- The plugin obfuscates native Android logs in Service Center. You need to use an external tool to deobfuscate the logs.
- JavaScript files obfuscation isn't supported.
- Native iOS bitcode obfuscation isn't supported.
- You need to contact Support to get the mapping files.

### When is this Article Useful?

This article provides valuable insights and solutions for those who are dealing with:

- **AppShield:** If you're using AppShield for your application and need assistance.
- **Application Obfuscation:** When you're looking to obfuscate your application for enhanced security.
- **Code Exposure:** If you're concerned about the exposure of your application's source code.
- **Obfuscation Error:** For troubleshooting errors or issues that occur during the obfuscation process.
- **Secure Code:** When you aim to ensure the highest level of security for your application's code.
- **Reverse Engineering:** If you want to defend your application against reverse engineering attempts.

If you are encountering any of the above issues or scenarios, this article will serve as a comprehensive guide to help you resolve them.

## Troubleshooting

Basic validations:

- Mobile app contains dependency to AppShield.
- AppShielding feature is enabled on the extensibility configurations:

- The code that is not obfuscated belongs to an OutSystems supported plugin:
    - AppShield only obfuscates the source code of supported plugins.
    - Obfuscating non-supported plugins isn't fully automatic in OutSystems and is necessary to configure custom obfuscation rules as is described in [this documentation](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/delivering_mobile_apps/harden_the_protection_of_mobile_apps_with_appshield/creating_custom_obfuscation_rules/).

Custom obfuscation rules

- If using custom obfuscation rules, verify if the rules are present in the extensibility configuration of the mobile module. It is recommended to use the [Obfuscation Helper](https://enmobile11.outsystemsenterprise.com/ObfuscationHelper/).

`{ "preferences": { "global": [ { "name": "AppShieldObfuscationRules", "value": (bases64-encoded rules) } ] } }`

- Confirm if the class that is not obfuscated was included in the custom obfuscation rules.

**[Android decompile]**: to decompile an apk and analyze the source code to see if it's obfuscated or not, [you can use Jadx from GitHub.](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

## Incident Resolution Measures

**Solution**

- Validate if AppShield is enabled in extensibility configurations;
- Check if the custom obfuscation rules are including the classes that are not obfuscated;
    - Non supported plugins are not obfuscated. These must be included in the custom obfuscation rules.
