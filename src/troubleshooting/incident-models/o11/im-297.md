<h1>Error executing PubSub jobs, X consecutive connections failed errors being logged in Event Viewer logs</h1>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Error executing PubSub jobs error being logged, Cache invalidation service not working, Environment Health: Cache service down/red cross</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2>

<p>This is a specific use case that generates the error.  Please be aware that you may be experiencing other causes for this error that are not listed here.  Even if the specific trigger for this error is not specified in this article, we still recommend applying the following troubleshooting steps to overcome the situation.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>One of the actions where the "Error executing PubSub jobs" error may manifest is when changes are made to the Site Properties of the module which are not reflected at the application level vecause the cache invalidation is not occurring.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Confirm the status of the RabbitMQ Service status:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a command-line console (run as Administrator) and change to the RabbitMQ batch scripts folder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute the following command: <br/>
<code>rabbitmqctl.bat status</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside the Controller Server (if it is the server where the RabbitMQ is installed), open the Configuration Tool and perform the Test Connection on the Cache tab:</p>
    
![Screenshot of the Configuration Tool showing a successful test connection with a notification popup stating 'Test completed successfully'.](images/im-image-99099710-45bf-43cb-af39-1055461e5250.png "Configuration Tool Test Connection Success")</li>

<li>Collect both the Application and System Event Viewer Logs in case they are needed for further review.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the results of running the script <code>rabbitmqctl.bat status </code>show the service is not running, then follow the steps below: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a command-line console (run as Administrator) and change your directory to the RabbitMQ batch scripts folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute the following commands to remove the currently running service, install a new one, and start it:</p>

<p><code>rabbitmq-service.bat remove</code> <br/>
<code>rabbitmq-service.bat install</code> <br/>
<code>rabbitmq-service.bat start</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the connection test performed previously with the Configuration Tool in the Cache tab was not successful, click the Create and Upgrade Service button in the Configuration Tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the RabbitMQ Service seems to be running and working as expected and the error is still thrown, the likely cause is that the module's settings were not reapplied after the RabbitMQ configurations were changed. To address this, follow the steps below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Republish the affected modules (the module names are visible in the error stack of the "Error executing PubSub jobs" errors found on the Event Viewer logs gathered earlier)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case Service Center is the affected module:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Reinstall Service Center using the script SCInstall.bat with Administrator mode on each of their servers. (found under the platform install destination folder) </em></li>
<li>
<p><em>Access Service Center -&gt; Solutions and republish Systems Components solution</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Create a solution containing all the modules from the environment. Press the Apply Settings button (it is not necessary to republish all of the  modules)</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
