<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Validate if all the timezones are correct and synchronized in all the Front End servers and the Database server. It is a requirement for all servers to be in the same timezone and synchronized.</li>
    <li>If time is synchronized on all the Front Ends, then validate the following:
    <ul>
        <li>In the Deployment Controller server, restart the following services:
        <ul>
            <li>OutSystems Deployment Controller Service</li>
            <li>OutSystems Deployment Service</li>
            <li>OutSystems Scheduler Service</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the other Front Ends of that environment, restart the following services.
    <ul>
        <li>OutSystems Deployment Service</li>
        <li>OutSystems Scheduler Service</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the issue is still present even after doing the above restarts, then it may attempt downloading the license and re-uploading it again into that Environment.
    <ul>
        <li>Go to the Customer Portal and download the license file for the affected environment, as per the article <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/enterprise_customers/licensing/manage_and_upgrade/get_a_license_file_for_an_environment/">Get a license file for an environment</a> (section 'Getting the license file')</li>
        <li>Go to the Service Center of the affected environment, and backup your current license using the "backup license" link, as per the article <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/enterprise_customers/licensing/manage_and_upgrade/how_to_install_a_license_file/">How to install a license file</a></li>
        <li>Upload the new license file that you downloaded on the first step, also as per the article <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/enterprise_customers/licensing/manage_and_upgrade/how_to_install_a_license_file/">How to install a license file</a></li>
        <li>Restart the services as mentioned previously.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the issue still persists after doing all the above, it is possible that the license settings were tampered or corrupted.

        <li>Collect the contents of the OSSYS_ACTIVATION table from the Database;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
