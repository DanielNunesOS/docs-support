<h1>Issue opening Service Studio from LifeTime or AI Mentor Studio</h1><p><br/></p><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: The "Compare modules in Service Studio" option in LifeTime does not work, "Open in Service Studio" option in AI Mentor Studio does not work, "Failed to execute 'assign' on 'Location'" error.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p>This issue started happening after Chrome released version 130.0.6723.69/.70 for Windows, Mac and 130.0.6723.69 for Linux (<a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_22.html">Chrome release notes</a>).</p><p>Currently, the issue only seems to affect Chromium based browsers, as it was reported on Chrome and Edge.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>LifeTime provides an option to compare module versions of different environments, using Service Studio.</p>

<p>In both cases, there should be a pop-up asking to open Service Studio and, if allowed, Service Studio should be automatically opened.</p>

<p>Due to this issue, the pop-up does not appear and Service Studio is never opened. Instead there is an error thrown in the browsers console.</p>

<p><br/></p><h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2><p>The issue was identified to be caused by how both LifeTime and AI Mentor Studio generate URLs, which only started having an impact after the latest Chrome release.</p><p>Since a permanent solution will require reviewing the generation of URLs on both places affected, two Problem Records were created to address this issue. RPM-5292 will be focused on LifeTime while RPM-5294 is directed at AI Mentor Studio. For LifeTime specifically we recommend monitoring the <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/release_notes/lifetime_management_console/">release notes page</a> to confirm which new version includes a fix for this issue.</p><p>In the meantime, there are two known workarounds:</p><ol><li>Use a browser that is not affected, such as Firefox, or downgrade the version of Chrome to one prior to the version affected, and disable auto-updates.</li><li><p>Run chrome from the command line with the flag: <code class="editorCode">--disable-features=StandardCompliantNonSpecialSchemeURLParsing</code></p></li></ol>
