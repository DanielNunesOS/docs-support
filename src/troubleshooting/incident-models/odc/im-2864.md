<h1>ERROR: operator does not exist / ERROR: operator is not unique in Advanced SQL</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>While testing an Advanced SQL query in ODC Studio, you may find the below errors:</p>

<p><code class="editorCode">ERROR: operator does not exist: (...)</code></p>

<p><code class="editorCode">ERROR: operator is not unique: (...)</code></p>

<p><br/>
Example below:<br/>

<h2> </h2>

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<p>For context, ODC uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> as the underlying database provider.</p>

<p>This comes with some limitations inherent to the system, such as type conversion rules which can cause errors for Advanced SQL queries - being Advanced SQL queries, these are customized by developers and ODC Studio cannot take into account and protect against all potential error scenarios.</p>

<p>As such, these errors are direct results returned by the database, and can be resolved according to PostgreSQL rules. We'll explain how to resolve some of these scenarios below, as examples.</p>

<h2> </h2>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>ERROR: operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone - integer</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    ![Example of an SQL query error due to an operator not existing between a timestamp and an integer.](images/im-image-ck-6b98a858-f2ec-46eb-9be5-8c18344c1b65.png "SQL Operator Error Example")<br/>
    <br/>
    This error can occur when using an operator between two types for which that operator does not exist. In the example above, <strong>Created</strong> is a <strong>Date Time</strong> type (ODC), which corresponds to a <em>timestamp with time zone</em> type in PostgreSQL.<br/>
    <br/>
    According to official documentation <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">9.9. Date/Time Functions and Operators</a>, adding/subtracting from a <em>timestamp</em> type only works with the <em>interval</em><strong> </strong>type:<br/>
    <br/>
    ![Excerpt from PostgreSQL documentation showing the correct use of an interval with a timestamp.](images/im-image-ck-a2bbad5f-78a6-4cde-9ca0-1f6f1ba79e98.png "PostgreSQL Date/Time Functions")<br/>
    <br/>
    To resolve this, we may simply replace the <em>integer</em> with the corresponding <em>interval</em> cast, such as <code class="editorCode">INTERVAL '1 DAY'</code> for the example above:<br/>
    <br/>
    ![Corrected SQL query replacing an integer with an interval to fix the operator error.](images/im-image-ck-737daab9-dff1-419a-8d91-642a2640f788.png "Corrected SQL Query with Interval")<br/>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>ERROR: operator is not unique: unknown + unknown</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    ![Screenshot showing an error message for a non-unique operator in an SQL query.](images/im-image-ck-4b5add76-81bf-4c9d-b024-ac8f7052f2a3.png "Non-Unique Operator Error Message")<br/>
    <br/>
    This error can occur when operators are used between <em>input parameters</em>.<br/>
    <br/>
    Basically, Advanced SQL statements are first <strong>Prepared</strong>, in which <em>input parameters</em> are all replaced with <em>?</em>, and then <strong>Executed</strong> as a function, with a list of arguments to replace each <em>?</em> in order.<br/>
    <br/>
    For the example above, we could imagine that, behind the scenes, the <strong>Prepared</strong> statement becomes something like this:<br/>
    <br/>
    <code class="editorCode">SELECT {Test}.* FROM {Test} WHERE {Test}.[Value] &gt; ? + ?</code><br/>
    <br/>
    You can read more about this in the official documentation: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ecpg-dynamic.html#ECPG-DYNAMIC-INPUT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">36.5.2. Executing a Statement with Input Parameters</a><br/>
    <br/>
    The problem is that <em>?</em> is of unknown type, and thus result in the observed error <em>unknown + unknown</em>, because when the statement is <strong>Prepared</strong>, the data types are not clear and cannot be inferred from the context.<br/>
    <br/>
    To solve this, we must explicitly cast the types of the input parameters, such as <code class="editorCode">CAST(@InputParameter as Integer)</code> for the example above:<br/>
    <br/>

    </li>
</ul>
