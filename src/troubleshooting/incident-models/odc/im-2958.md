<h2>Error message</h2>

<p>Input validation error</p>

<p>Request input has the following issue: The 'foreignClaim.name' field contains unsupported character.</p>

<p>Request input has the following issue: The 'foreignClaim.name' field starts with unsupported character.</p>

<p>![Screenshot showing an input validation error message for the 'foreignClaim.name' field containing unsupported characters in the 'Add group mapping' dialog.](images/im-image-ck-cb9df5a4-9df9-4857-9328-74b1456f3d09.png "Input Validation Error for Group Mapping")</p>

<h2>Cause</h2>

<p>When configuring <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/user_management/configure_authentication_with_external_identity_providers/idp_and_end_user_group_mapping/">end-user group mapping</a>, the "Claim Name" field includes unsupported characters.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p>This will prevent the creation of Group Mapping for your external Identity Provider.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Ensure that you only use supported characters. As a general guideline, these are the supported characters:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alphabetic characters</li>
    <li>Numeric characters (only as non-starting characters)</li>
    <li>:</li>
    <li>$ and - (only as starting characters)</li>
</ul>
