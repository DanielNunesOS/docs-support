<h1>File Transfer Plugin UploadFile action corrupts image files</h1>


<h2>Precautions</h2>

<p>This only applies when the <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/integration_with_external_systems/mobile_plugins/file_transfer_plugin/">File Transfer Plugin</a> is used.</p>

<p>Affects both iOS and Android apps.</p>


<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>Basically, image files uploaded with the <strong>UploadFile</strong> action from the <strong>File Transfer Plugin</strong> become corrupted if we then try to download and open them - they simply will not open, such as below:</p>

<p><br/>
![Error message indicating that the file format is not supported for test4.jpeg.](images/im-image-ck-6c4a97d1-80ba-4a87-ae90-9a29837cea79.png "Corrupted Image File")</p>

<p>To confirm this, we can open the image file with Notepad and check whether it has metadata added at the top, instead of just binary content:</p>

<p><br/>
![Notepad displaying metadata at the top of an image file, including Content-Disposition and Content-Type headers.](images/im-image-ck-5612158a-95cc-4317-82bf-96a0b6473e37.png "Image File with Metadata")</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Further confirmation can be achieved by removing these lines from the top while still using the notepad - after removal, the image should now open as expected.</p>

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<p>Now, this is the expected behavior of the <strong>File Transfer Plugin</strong>, as per the plugin's <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fcordova-plugin-file-transfer%20multipartFormUpload&amp;type=code">source code</a> from Cordova.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31175836/cordova-file-transfer-remove-multipart-or-content-disposition-header" rel="noopener noreferrer">from this online thread</a>, a suggestion is to include a dummy header so it does not add any metadata to the file - again, based on the source code itself.</p>

<p>There is a simple way to do this, which is to replace the <strong>UploadFile</strong> action with the <strong>UploadFileWithHeaders</strong> action, also from the same plugin, and setting a dummy header such as Content-Type, for example:<br/>
<br/>
![Screenshot of the UploadFileWithHeaders action configuration in the OutSystems platform, showing the Content-Type header.](images/im-image-ck-51c3a06e-b5d9-4660-afdf-f25f8d6aa0ca.png "UploadFileWithHeaders Action")</p>

<p>This then does not add any metadata to image files, and thus does not corrupt them.</p>
