# Unable to log into ODC Portal due to issues with External Identity Provider

<p>Error Code: N/A<br/>
<strong>Symptoms</strong>: Unexpected error when authenticating with identity provider, Unable to authenticate in ODC Portal, ODC Portal is unavailable</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2>

<p>This may occur in situations where your External Identity Provider of choice is having some sort of issue that prevents authentication from being successful, and the Built-In Provider is unassigned from Organization Access, both of which cause ODC Portal to be inaccessible. The goal is not to solve the underlying problem with your IdP, but to mitigate the impact as much as possible by swiftly granting you access back to ODC Portal through the Built-In provider.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>When attempting to log into ODC Portal through an External Identity Provider, you may receive an error that prevents you from logging in successfully, such as the example below:</p>

<p>![Error message displayed when authentication with identity provider fails.](images/im-image-ck-72937555-9263-4d03-b283-79df40bfad6d.png "Authentication Error Message")</p>

<p>If an error like this is occurring and you unassigned Organization Access from the Built-in Provider, then you may be completely locked out of your ODC Organization, with no way of recovering access autonomously. An example of this may be that your IdP's client secret expired before you updated it in your ODC Portal configuration.</p>

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<p>If this happens, then you will need to contact our Global Support Team through the <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/home/">Support Portal</a>. Our team's immediate goal will be to reassign the Built-In Provider to Organization Access, which will allow you to log back in with the built-in credentials. When contacting us, please make it clear that we have your approval to perform these actions. For transparency, these will be the steps our team will take:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open your ODC Portal, go to "Identity Providers" and select the "<strong>Built-in Provider</strong>";</li>
    <li>Click on "Manage assignments":
    <ul>
        <li>![Screenshot showing the 'Manage assignments' option for the Built-in provider in ODC Portal.](images/im-image-ck-8e757f30-bdb8-4323-a2d1-6703e65a8fdb.png "Built-in Provider Management")</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Here, we'll toggle the "Organization" access so that it is enabled:
    <ul>
        <li>![Dialog box for assigning or unassigning the Built-in provider to the Organization in ODC Portal.](images/im-image-ck-a75c97c1-1c5c-4c82-b62a-48105e6d09f8.png "Assign/Unassign Built-in Provider")</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click on "Confirm changes and logout".</li>
</ol>

<p>After doing this, ODC Portal will be accessible through the Built-in credentials (if you don't recover your password, you also have the option to reset it) and, from there, you'll be able to work on the issue that caused your IdP to not work to begin with, and then unassign the built-in provider once again if you prefer.</p>
