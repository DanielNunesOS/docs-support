<h1>OS-BERT-60405 - with key inParamId was not found.</h1>

<h2>Error Message</h2>

<p><code class="editorCode">"runtime"."&lt;entity_hash&gt;" with key 'inParamId' was not found.</code></p>

<h2>Cause</h2>

<p>Typically, this occurs when a provided parameter value (e.g. an identifier) for such an entity action does not exist (for comparison, an Aggregate would simply return an empty list, but a Get entity action expects a result).</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>

<p>Aggregates, or other types of Data/Entity Actions, can end in errors.</p>

<h2>Recommended Action</h2>

<p> First, you must find the place where the error is occurring - to do this, you can go to the <strong>Traces</strong> in <strong>ODC Portal</strong> and select one of the error traces.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Below is an example where you can also see the inParamId parameter within the SQL statement, and which column this parameter value is not found in:<br/>

    <li>Alternatively, you may also follow the <strong>stack trace</strong> of the error to find the action/aggregate where the issue occurs:<br/>

</ul>

<p>Once you know where the error occurs, you must ensure that the provided value is neither NULL nor a non-existent value for that particular entity:</p>

<h2>More info</h2>

<p>It's important to note that <code class="editorCode">inParamId</code> is just the name used for input parameters in prepared statements in ODC.</p>

<p>Prepared statements can take parameters: values that are substituted into the statement when it is executed. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html">Read more about prepared statements in the PostgreSQL official documentation.</a></p>
