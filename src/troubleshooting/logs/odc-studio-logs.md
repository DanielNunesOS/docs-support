# ODC Studio logs

## ODC Studio report

When an unexpected error occurs in ODC Studio, you'll get an **Unexpected Error** window. In this window, you can obtain the error report to send to OutSystems Support.

To get the ODC Studio report, follow these steps:

1. Click **You can help us fix thisâ€¦** to expand the window if it's not expanded.

1. Open ODC Studio.

2. Replicate the behavior that needs to be investigated.
