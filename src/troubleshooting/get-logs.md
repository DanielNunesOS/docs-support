# How to get logs for troubleshooting purposes

This article explains how to get the logs and report files from the several OutSystems components and other system components.

In the context of a support case, OutSystems Support might require that you provide some of these files so they can troubleshoot the issues you are experiencing. In this situation, you should get the required files as described in this article and attach them to your support case.

## Get Service Studio Report

  		<div class="os-accordion__content">
   	        When an **unexpected error** occurs in Service Studio, you will get an Unexpected Error window. In this window, you can obtain the error report to send to OutSystems Support.
  		</div>
	</div>

When an **unexpected error** occurs in Service Studio, you will get an Unexpected Error window. In this window, you can obtain the error report to send to OutSystems Support.
