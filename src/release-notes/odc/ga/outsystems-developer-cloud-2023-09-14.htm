<ul>
<li>Added the stage information to the logs and traces' detail pages.  (RDLOT-2029)</li>
<li>Added the element icons to the tree view, on the Trace detail page. (RDLOT-2033)</li>
<li>The tree view, on the Trace detail page, is now wider by default, with the option to reduce the section horizontally when needed. (RDLOT-2034)</li>
<li>Added two new options on the Trace detail page to expand or collapse all the spans with a single click.  (RDLOT-2035)</li>
<li>On the Trace detail page, will be presented an information banner to inform the user when the trace is still being processed or it finished processing with some missing spans. (RDLOT-2037)</li>
<li>Now the Trace detail page will have a new entry called 'Undefined nodes', to present the spans whose parents are missing from the trace. This situation can happen when the trace is still being processed or when there is an issue processing the trace information. (RDLOT-2038)</li>
<li>On the Trace detail page, the default view will now present only the first three span levels expanded, reducing the amount of information displayed initially and allowing the user to only expand the spans that are relevant for the troubleshooting. (RDLOT-2039)</li>
<li>The Trace and Logs detail pages on the ODC Portal now feature an option “Clear filters“ for easily clearing all selected filters with a single click, enhancing the user search experience. (RDLOT-2040)</li>
<li>Now, the related logs table presented on the Trace detail page will not appear when there are no logs to show for a specific span.  (RDLOT-2181)</li>
