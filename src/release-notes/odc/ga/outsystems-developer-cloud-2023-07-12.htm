<ul>
<li>The application detail screen on the ODC Portal now presents the publish date and user for the development stage and presents the deployment date and user for other stages. (RDLOT-1937)</li>
<li>From now on it’s possible to install several assets in Forge simultaneously, being able to check progress on a side panel. All users inside an organization will be able to install assets that don’t conflict with another ongoing installation when needed (RMKPT-2485)</li>
<li>New approval e-mail template updated for when a submitted asset is approved (RMKPT-2487)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_outsystems_developer_cloud_2023-07-12" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the mobile distribution tab, on the app detail screen, that would present the ‘Create package' button as enabled when the user didn’t have permission to perform the operation. The user would still be blocked from creating a mobile package, but now the validation is performed earlier, and the button will be disabled in this situation. (RDLOT-1900)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the mobile distribution tab, on the app detail screen, that would expand/collapse the mobile package information when clicking on the download packages or download logs buttons. (RDLOT-2001)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the ODC Portal that would block the users from changing app configurations when there was an error during 1CP. (RDLOT-2014)</li>
<li>Fixed the link that redirects to the MABS documentation when creating a new mobile package. (RDLOT-2018)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was causing an error in the number of characters validation in the detailed description field when submitting an asset to Forge. (RMKPT-2479)</li>
<li>Fixed the detection of network errors that were being identified as generic Forge errors. (RMKPT-2480)</li>
</ul>
