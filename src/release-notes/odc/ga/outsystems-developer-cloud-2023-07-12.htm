<h3 id="bug_fixing_outsystems_developer_cloud_2023-07-12" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the mobile distribution tab, on the app detail screen, that would present the ‘Create package' button as enabled when the user didn’t have permission to perform the operation. The user would still be blocked from creating a mobile package, but now the validation is performed earlier, and the button will be disabled in this situation. (RDLOT-1900)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the mobile distribution tab, on the app detail screen, that would expand/collapse the mobile package information when clicking on the download packages or download logs buttons. (RDLOT-2001)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the ODC Portal that would block the users from changing app configurations when there was an error during 1CP. (RDLOT-2014)</li>
<li>Fixed the link that redirects to the MABS documentation when creating a new mobile package. (RDLOT-2018)</li>
</ul>
