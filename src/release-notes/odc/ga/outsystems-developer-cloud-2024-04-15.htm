<li>We have improved the main menu on ODC Portal to make it easier for you to navigate through the Portal features. You can now also collapse those main menu entries that are less relevant to you, keeping you focused on the ones that you use on a regular basis. (RDPP-1585)</li>
<li>Improved the experience when managing the assignments of an Identity Provider with a tooltip explaining why certain options may be disabled. (RDPP-1604)</li>
