<ul>
<li>Small UX tweaks and improvements on the deployments console. Now the stage selection dropdown in deployments list page is disabled when there is only one stage to display and stage names that are very big will not break the UX for the whole deployment journey. (RDEL-1703)</li>
<li>Improved the deployment experience. Now ODC seamlessly tries to recover from scenarios where a valid build does not exist for the selected app revision. In those situations, we will let you know that we are preparing your app and resume the deploy once it is ready. (RDEL-1836)</li>
</ul>
