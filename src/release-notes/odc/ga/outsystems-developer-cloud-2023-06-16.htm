<li>Fixed an issue that would randomly present the file size error even when the uploaded file was within the supported size limit. (RDLOT-1905)</li>

<li>Fixed a bug that caused External Library Actions names clashing with Structures names, resulting in a compilation error (OS-ELGW-50014) while publishing. (RTAFB-6784)</li>
