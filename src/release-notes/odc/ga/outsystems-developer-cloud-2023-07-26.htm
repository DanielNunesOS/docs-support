<ul>
<li>A new section is now available in the ODC Portal to enable easy access management on your applications. IP filters will allow you to restrict access to your portfolio of applications for specific IP addresses, for instance, users on your internal network, or in a certain office location. This feature is included in the App Security Plus add-on. (RDLOT-2163)</li>
<li>Added the capability of assigning Organizational Roles at the Application scope.  App scope streamlines and enhances access while ensuring people have access to what they need and don’t have access to everything. In the App scope section, you can Manage roles. This enables you to select the app and the role you want to give to a member. (RDPP-1274)</li>
</ul>
