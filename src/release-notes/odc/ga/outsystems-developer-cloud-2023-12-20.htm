<ul>
<li>From now on the entity attribute mismatch in the Impact Analysis during the deploy operation will specify the name of each attribute, instead of just the number of attributes. (RDEL-2026)</li>
<li>Adjusted the feedback message that appears when interacting with ODC Studio from the Apps screens in the ODC Portal (open/create an app), to allow the download of the ODC Studio native version for MacOS users, which provides performance improvements for devices that have the new M-series processors. (RDLOT-2352)</li>
<li>Now itâ€™s possible to undeploy apps from the Production stage. After this operation, users will no longer have access to the application in that stage, and it will be possible to delete the app from the tenant afterward. (RDLOT-2454)</li>
</ul>
