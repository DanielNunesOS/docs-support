<ul>
<li>It's now possible to create API Clients with credentials to call ODC REST APIs. This new feature leverages the ODC fine-grain control permissions system, focusing on security and flexibility in machine-to-machine communication via a streamlined user experience. (RDPIB-2249)</li>
<li>We've enhanced user and access management by introducing a new and robust suite of APIs. These APIs empower developers to build custom scripts and user experiences to automate user management and their access to applications directly or through end-user groups. (RDPIB-2250)</li>
<li>We are introducing Portfolio APIs that provide data on deployed assets with deployment status per environment (stage). These APIs support user and access management use cases, enabling developers to build custom scripts and user experiences for portfolio management. (RDPIB-2251)</li>
