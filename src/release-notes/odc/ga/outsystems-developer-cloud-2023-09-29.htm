<ul>
<li>Improved asset submission experience in Forge, by giving the correct feedback to the user explaining that it is not possible to submit assets that depend on external connections.  (RMKPT-2403)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_outsystems_developer_cloud_2023-09-29" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that was blocking the visibility of the install panel in Forge. When assets were being installed, if the filterâ€™s panel was expanded and the screen resolution was low, the install panel would appear behind the filters and so being hidden.  (RMKPT-2553)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Forge, that caused the filters list to appear duplicated when users returned to the All Assets screen using the Back button of the browser. (RMKPT-2614)</li>
</ul>
