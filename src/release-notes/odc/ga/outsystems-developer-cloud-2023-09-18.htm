<ul>
<li>When seeing the users associated to an organization role, we now also show the user’s email to better distinguish between users with the same name. (RDPP-1187)</li>
<li>Updated the invite user screen to show only 3 end-user groups at a time, to improve the screen’s readability. (RDPP-1295)</li>
<li>When inviting new users, the end-user group cards now have a link on the group name to see the group’s details. This allows users to gain more context about each group while assigning them. (RDPP-1296)</li>
<li>Updated the terminology used throughout ODC Portal when referring to a workforce user’s access privileges from “Member access” to “Organization Access”, to make it more clear what it refers to. (RDPP-1375)</li>
