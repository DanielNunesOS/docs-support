<li>Added a new maintainability pattern “Reminder Comments” which helps to identify comments marked as "Is Reminder" that may indicate important technical debt or unresolved issues.

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue on the AI Mentor Studio API where the method {{TechnicalDebt_Team}} only returned the team if it had at least one application. (RADRT-2843)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue within the AI Mentor Studio API method TechnicalDebt_Application, where it was returning an empty record with default values {CategoryGUID = "", PatternGUID = "", Count = 0} when the application/module did not have any findings. (RADRT-2876)</li>
</ul>
