<h2>Integration Builder 1.34.0</h2>
<div class="info"><p>This is a preliminary version of the document.</p></div>

<h3>New in Integration Builder 1.34.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a hint that illustrates how to input port information on relational database connections. (RCNT-4701)</li>
<li>MongoDB integrations just got easier. A new version of the MongoDB connector is now available. Now, collections can be represented in structure format, meaning Integration Builder inspects the collection schema and generates Structures. The previously introduced, JSON output format, is still available. The MongoDB integrations are available exclusively in the latest version of Integration Builder and are fully supported by the OutSystems platform. Find out more about MongoDB integrations in our documentation. (RCNT-4854)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Invalid connections are displayed in Integration Manager when a plugin is reinstalled. (RCNT-4731)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where MongoDB integrations kept the "pending changes" warning after being published. (RCNT-4794)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that allowed users to attempt republishing integrations while the dependency update process was running, causing concurrency errors. (RCNT-4809)</li>
</ul>
