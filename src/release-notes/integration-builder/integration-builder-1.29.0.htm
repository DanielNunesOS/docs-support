</div>
    
<h3>New in Integration Builder 1.26.0</h3>
    
<ul>
<li>Now, you can set tables/entities/lists of integrations as read-only or read-write. This feature is available when integrating with the following systems of records: SAP OData, Salesforce, SharePoint Online, Microsoft Dataverse, and Microsoft Dynamics.</li>
<li>SAP OData "Get" actions now have an output specifying which attributes are null on SAP's side.

Existing SAP OData integrations will continue to work until they are republished.<br />
Integration Builder helps you with the republishing process, listing all integrations that should be republished.<br />
Once you republish existing SAP OData integrations with Integration Builder, you must open the consumer apps in Service Studio, refresh their dependencies to the integration, and then republish these apps.</li>
</ul>
