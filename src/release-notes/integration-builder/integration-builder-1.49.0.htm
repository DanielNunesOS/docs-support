<h3 id="new_in_integration_builder_1.49.0" >New in Integration Builder 1.49.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for transactions to the MongoDB connectors created by the Integration Builder. (RCNT-4777)</li>
<li>Now, marking a Salesforce object as “read-only” will allow you to unselect most of its attributes. (RCNT-6831)</li>
<li>Now, marking a SharePoint list as “read-only” will allow you to unselect most of its fields. (RCNT-6833)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_integration_builder_1.49.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an error un-checking the ‘Access type' checkbox on the 'Add Objects' step of Salesforce integrations and on the 'Add Lists’ step of SharePoint integrations. (RCNT-6844)</li>
<li>Fixed an "Index out of bounds" error when setting custom Foreign Keys on Relational Database Integrations. (RCNT-6881)</li>
<li>Breaking change: we were using an attribute that could be modified as an identifier for SharePoint columns. We had to change it, so some columns that were previously selected might need to be selected again when you edit a SharePoint integration. The system will display a warning message when this happens. (RCNT-6907)</li>
</ul>
