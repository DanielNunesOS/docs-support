<h3 id="new_in_mabs_2023-10-30" > New</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed functionality that was specifically adding {{aps-environments}} to plist when present in the provisioning profile. This should be handled by each plugin making use of the {{aps-environment}} entitlement, and not generically by MABS since not all applications need this. (RNMT-5935)</li>
<li>MABS 10 now uses Node 18 and NPM 8. (RNMT-6064)</li>
<li>Update Native Shell to target the latest iOS 17 SDK. (RNMT-6167)</li>
<li>The legacy Android Support Libraries ({{com.android.support}}) are no longer supported. Builds containing these libraries will fail until they are migrated to their [+respective AndroidX counterpart+|https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate/artifact-mappings]. Owners of non-supported plugins using Android Support Libraries must migrate their plugins to work with MABS 10. (RNMT-6187)</li>
<li>Update Native Shell to target the latest Android 14 SDK. (RNMT-6192)</li>
<li>MABS 10 now uses SQLite version 3.40.0. (RNMT-6287)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_mabs_2023-10-30" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the build to fail in some edge cases, when using the <a href=”[https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/config_ref/|https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/config_ref/|smart-link] ”>cordova preferences</a> {{android-minSdkVersion}} and {{deployment-target}}. (RNMT-6290)</li>
</ul>
