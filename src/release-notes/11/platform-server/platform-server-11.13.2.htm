This was an error in Users application related to the encrypt/decrypt password algorithm. The issue was found in version 11.7.3 and it's now fixed.</p><p><a id="RPM-1078"><strong>RPM-1078</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an upgrade schema error when clicking "Create/Upgrade Database" in the Configuration Tool while upgrading the Platform Server from version 10 to version 11.11.1 or later. This issue applies only to self-managed environments.</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>While upgrading the Platform Server component in a self-managed environment from version 10 to version 11.11.1 or later, clicking the "Create/Upgrade Database" button in the Configuration Tool caused the upgrade schema error "Unable to obtain the connection string". Besides blocking the upgrade process, this issue didn't cause downtime or loss of service.</p><p><a id="RPM-1128"><strong>RPM-1128</strong></a><br><b>Improved the performance of the modules preparation phase executed during the upgrade process.</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>The <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Upgrading/Modules_preparation_step_during_Platform_Server_upgrade" rel="internal">module preparation phase</a> after a Platform Server upgrade could take a long time to complete, increasing the time a development team would have to go without being able to publish any modules. This is especially noticeable in large factories and it would only occur in Platform Server 11.12.0 or later.
The module preparation was improved to be more performant.</p><p><a id="RPM-1278"><strong>RPM-1278</strong></a><br><b>Fixed a high severity vulnerability by upgrading the packaged RabbitMQ to 3.8.21.</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>All versions of RabbitMQ prior to 3.8.16 are prone to a denial of service vulnerability.  The packaged RabbitMQ was upgraded. You can check more details in this <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Security/Vulnerabilities/Vulnerability_RPM-1278" rel="internal">security bulletin.</a></p><p><a id="RPM-1434"><strong>RPM-1434</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused the incorrect calculation of the average time in Service Actions Performance report.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>The Service Actions Performance report in Service Center showed incorrect values for  "Avg. Time". 
When generating or exporting a Service Actions Performance report from the Analytics tabs of Service Center, the report showed the same value for both "Avg. Time" and "Total Time" columns.</p><p><a id="RPM-1466"><strong>RPM-1466</strong></a><br><b>Fixed a malformed login URL for SAML 2.0 when using an external IdP with SSO login URL containing query parameters.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Authentication and Authorization</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>After setting up SAML 2.0 in Users, app end users that try to log in get redirected to the User app with a permission denied message.
The issue occurred due to a malformed login URL when using SAML 2.0 with a Single Sign-On URL that contained a query parameter.</p><p><a id="RPM-1487"><strong>RPM-1487</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that occurred when clicking "Apply and Exit" in the Configuration Tool after changing the Platform, Log, or Session database configurations.</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>Configuration Tool was not respecting alterations to the databases connection details (Platform, Log, and Session). Changes done in the Configuration Tool UI were not effectively saved. Upon clicking "Apply an Exit", older values (for example: database address, authentication mode and credentials) would be used, ultimately causing connection errors or operations to be attempted with the old values.
The issue was fixed, and values changed in the UI are now fully respected.</p><p><a id="RPM-1502"><strong>RPM-1502</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that might cause the Configuration Tool to lock the Administrator or Runtime Active Directory accounts when using Windows Authentication.</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>When using Windows Authentication, opening the Configuration Tool could lock the Administrator or Runtime user accounts in the Active Directory. This would happen under a strict security policy to lock user accounts on first failed login attempt.
This issue occurred because the Configuration Tool was attempting to login to the database with the Administrator and Runtime users as soon as the UI is opened, which doesn't apply to Windows Authentication.</p><p><a id="RPM-1509"><strong>RPM-1509</strong></a><br><b>Fixed a licensing query that would generate "Licensing error" entries in Service Center Error logs.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Licensing Runtime Checks</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>In Service Center error logs, an entry with the message: "Licensing Error: An error occurred while validating feature 'InternalExternalUsersCounter': ORA-00972" would happen frequently. Appart from log polution, there was no futher impact. It would happen only when all of the following conditions are true:
</p><ul><li>the Platform Server version is 11.11.3 or later</li>
<li>the platform database is Oracle 12.1c</li>
<li>the license was purchased after January 2020</li></ul>
<br>
The issue was fixed in an OutSystems internal query to no longer result in such an error.<p><a id="RPM-1537"><strong>RPM-1537</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue where the Configuration Tool UI was not disabling Log and Session database credential fields when using Windows Authentication.</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>In the Configuration Tool, when authentication is set to Windows Authentication on the Platform tab, login errors could occur.

The Administrator, Runtime, and Session credential fields in the Log and Session tabs should be disabled. The issue would cause the fields to be editable. This would force the user to fill in those fields, and, when the credentials didn't match, would cause a login error.</p><p><a id="RPM-912"><strong>RPM-912</strong></a><br><b>Fixed a compilation issue when consuming a SOAP Web Service containing a type and a subtype with the same name.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>A compilation error occurred after publishing a module which consumed a SOAP Web Service with polymorphism.
This only occurred when one of the possible subtypes declares an anonymous type with the name as the subtype.</p>

This could cause the events on the logs not to reflect the order in which they actually occurred, making it harder to understand the logs and troubleshoot a mobile app.
The behavior was fixed and the timestamp of the logs now reflects the exact time of the event.</p><p><a id="RPM-1265"><strong>RPM-1265</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused the Environment Information not to be filled in the Service Center error logs.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Logging</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>The issue would sometimes manifest when the device running the mobile app was offline and an error occurred. When the device comes online, the information is sent to the server to log. The log was written, however, the Environment Information field as seen in the error log detail didn't contain any data.
Such information is useful to provide the runtime context in which the error occurred.
This issue didn't cause any impact on the mobile app's normal usage nor on the end-user experience.</p><p><a id="RPM-1308"><strong>RPM-1308</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue in PWA applications where splash screens would hang on iOS 14.6 devices.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Application Distribution</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>According to <a title="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/apple_safari_indexeddb_bug/" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/apple_safari_indexeddb_bug/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-https">https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/...indexeddb_bug/</a>  Apple's WebKit team has managed to break the popular IndexedDB JavaScript API in the latest version of Safari (14.1.1) on macOS 11.4 and iOS 14.6.</p><p><a id="RPM-1352"><strong>RPM-1352</strong></a><br><b>Fixed broken references errors to indirect producers after an upgrade to Platform Server 11.12.1 or higher.</b><br><span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>After upgrading to 11.12.1 and publishing a module, runtime errors due to incompatible definitions might occur.
The issue would occur when a consumer module A is using a producer module B and that producer, in turn, has a producer C that references an extension E. In that case, module A would have errors about incompatibility with an Action from extension E.</p><p><a id="RPM-1371"><strong>RPM-1371</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused navigations to the previous screen to go back more screens than it should.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>On a Mobile or Reactive Web app, a screen that has a link that navigates to the previous screen would go instead to the screen before that. Effectively the navigation would send users to 2 screens before the screen they were on. More specifically, the wrong previous screen navigation occurs only after a navigation is performed on an OnInitialize event of a screen.
The issue happens only with applications compiled on Platform Server version 11.12.0 or higher. It may happen on previous Platform Server versions, if the environment had the React 16 Technical Preview feature activated.

The issue was fixed in this version and the wrong redirect will no longer occur.</p><p><a id="RPM-599"><strong>RPM-599</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused disabled Scheduler services to pick up events and email tasks that they would not process. This also caused a permanent warning displayed on the monitoring pages.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>When configuring the servers it is possible to disable BPT processing for specific servers. This issue caused some events to be picked up during the disabled schedulers startup but never processed.
The issue does not exist if all servers are allowed to execute BPT.</p><p><a id="RPM-728"><strong>RPM-728</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an integrated authentication vulnerability in OutSystem Cloud environments. CVSSv3.1 score 5.5 (Medium).</b><br><span class="cattag">Cloud Paas</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>Fixed a vulnerability that would allow, in the OutSystems Cloud, users with access to the underlying infrastructure to be able to access applications developed in the environment.
The vulnerability was fixed so that it no longer allows privileged users with infrastructure access to log in to applications.</p><p><a id="RPM-921"><strong>RPM-921</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that was preventing developers from using the Distribute tab in Service Studio.
