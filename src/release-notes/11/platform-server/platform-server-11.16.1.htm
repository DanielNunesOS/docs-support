<b>Fixed an error when setting IT users permissions and there are more than 1000 application permissions. This issue applied only to environments using an Oracle database.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When registering a new Oracle environment in the infrastructure through the LifeTime console, the environment synchronization generated several errors in the advanced query RemoveDeprecatedPermissions, which is executed by an internal Platform Server API. This problem only occurred for Oracle environments having more than 1000 application permissions.

<b>Changed client side JSON serialize to solve inconsistency with the server side one </b><br/>

<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
*Symptoms*
Client-side JSON Serialization is not consistent with the server-side one in scenarios where the default values are not to be serialized. The scenarios that are failing are the following:

 - Nested Structures whose all attributes have the default value are serialized as an empty object instead of ignored
    Client: {"NestedStructure":{"text":"Test","object":{}}}
    Server: {"NestedStructure":{"text":"Test"}}

 - Empty Lists are serialized instead of ignored
    Client: {"arrayempty":[]}
    Server: {}

 - Boolean attributes with True as default value are serialized instead of ignored
    Client: {"ChatFormat":{"UseAnimation":true}}
    Server: {}

 - Default values on Lists are serialized as null instead of the default value
    Client: {"arrayinitialized":[null,1]}
    Server: {"arrayinitialized":[0,1]}

*How to reproduce*
- Create a variable with a value matching one of the scenarios above
- JSON Serialize the variable with the "Serialize Default Values" option set to "No" on a Client Action
- JSON Serialize the variable with the "Serialize Default Values" option set to "No" on a Server Action
- You can verify that the result is different

<b>Fixed a validation issue in the Dropdown widget for Reactive Web and Mobile apps when the "Empty Text" property is set.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Interface</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
This issue occurred in Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps having a Dropdown widget with the "Empty Text" property set. When a value was selected in the Dropdown, after clearing that value by setting the bound variable value to its default, the Widget would incorrectly pass the required validation although no value was selected.

<b>Reduced unnecessary error log pollution caused by platform telemetry collection</b><br/>

<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
Customer is experiencing many timeouts in the Timer SynchronizeMetrics (from Service Center) execution due to a query taking a long time to execute, only for Oracle installations.

<b>Improved the performance of solution publish app synchronisation.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
*Symptoms*
Deadlock errors during synchronization in LifeTime.

*How to reproduce*
This problem is already minimized in recent versions of the platform (LT 11.8.0+) that have improvements over the Synchronization process, compared to older versions. Nevertheless, the problem can occur when Service Studio publishes are done while a Sync Environment is running.
