<h2 id="platform_server_11.28.0" >Platform Server 11.28.0</h2>
<div class="info"><p>Released on Jun 03, 2024</p></div>


<style>.cattag {background: #f4f2ff; color: #6a6581; padding: 4px 10px;}</style>
<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_11.28.0" >New in Platform Server 11.28.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scheduler service now uses two communication ports: primary and secondary. The new primary port (12102) is necessary for product evolution and technology resiliency and its value must be distinct from the secondary port. (R11BRT-940)</li>
<li>Implemented a new feature to trace information about Mobile/Reactive cookies. An entry in the General Logs is created for each request coming from the apps. This log will contain redacted details about request/response cookies and some troubleshooting messages. This feature is disabled by default and is exclusively meant to be used by Technical Support in Support Cases. (R11DT-2451)</li>
<li>Launched a tentative workaround for a <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=272325">WebKit issue</a> that causes sessions to be randomly lost on Apple devices (usually iOS 17 but also MacOS). The symptom is a random 403 error a few seconds after a login. Only reactive and mobile apps are affected. Considering that the resolution of the underlying issue is beyond OutSystems’ control, we're releasing this tentative workaround that assigns no max-age to anonymous cookies. Tests indicate that this can effectively prevent the 403 error. It can be enabled on Factory Configuration 11.2.1 under the 'Disable Max Age for Anonymous cookies in Mobile/Reactive' option. (R11DT-2497)</li>
<li>Introduced a new feature that allows disabling unsafe-eval and unsafe-inline from Content Security Police in reactive apps. This feature can be turned on in Factory Configuration 11.2.1 by unchecking the options "Enforce Unsafe Eval/Inline Reactive". The support for mobile apps isn't yet available.<br/>
<b>Note</b>: Files app_offline.aspx, forbidden.aspx, and default.css from the customHandler folder, located in the platform root installation folder, will be overwritten with a new version that no longer depends on unsafe-inline. A backup of the old files is created in a new folder named 'customHandlerBackup' in the platform root installation folder. (RPM-3117) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.28.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the Configuration Tool to fail when updating configurations in the database during upgrades from O10 or older versions, specifically when using Oracle as the Platform database. (R11BRT-922)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the exported logs file to have columns with no data when Log Separation is enabled. This occurred in Errors, Traditional Web Requests, Screen Requests, Service Actions and Integrations monitoring pages. (R11PST-272)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused publications to fail due to a NullReferenceException Internal Error during the “Preparing Deploy” phase when publishing a solution.  (R11PST-282)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the Built-in Function NewDate to incorrectly generate Daylight Saving Time (DST) dates starting at 00:00. This issue only happened in reactive and mobile apps. (RPM-1863) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a deploy to skip deployment final steps when the DeployService loses the ongoing deploy's status.
This occurred when DeployService was restarted between the 1st and 2nd stage.
Now, the deploy's status are cached during the service shutdown and recovered during its initialization. (RPM-3330) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed the issue that caused Configuration Tool to fail to execute parameters while using integrated authentication.
Now, in order to execute certain parameters in integrated authentication scenarios, Configuration Tool requires passing the integrated authentication password with the /WithWindowsAuthentication parameter. 
Please check the <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=7c953aae-e0ef-4034-afcf-84960d18ad3b">documentation</a> for more details. (RPM-3974) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the 'checkIfCurrentUserHasRole' client action from returning the correct value. This only occurred for Reactive web apps with SSO enabled and if the user's logout and login were made in a Traditional Web app. Now, this action returns the expected result. (RPM-4195) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Client Actions to be executed, instead of System Client Actions, when named "OnAplicationReady" or "OnAplicationResume". Now, Client Actions with the previously mentioned names will automatically be renamed. (RPM-4391) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Introduced a note in the installation checklist when upgrading Platform Server to a minor version with an Oracle Database. It now recommends upgrading the Session Database in Configuration Tool. This prevents some performance issues detected when upgrading from older (for example: 11.10.0) to more recent versions. (RPM-4478) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Platform Installation Checklist</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a rendering misbehavior affecting List and Table widgets in reactive and mobile. This occurs when these widgets are placed inside a Form with built-in validations and their items contain mandatory inputs. Some validation messages may disappear if one inserts or removes elements in the source list. This fix is disabled by default and can be enabled in Factory Configuration 11.2.0 (Preserve List item keys in Mobile/Reactive). The affected applications must then be republished. (RPM-4532) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Interface</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused downloaded files to have their filename garbled. This occurred in Safari browsers when downloading a file that contained non-ASCII characters.
Now, Traditional apps can encode filenames in UTF-8 after enabling it via Factory Configuration 11.2.0 (Add UTF-8 encoded filename header to file download in Traditional).<br/><b>Important Note</b>: For environments with purposes other than Production, simply enabling the setting and republishing will not make any effect. <br/>To apply the settings, choose one of the following options: <ol><li>Make changes to the screens containing the download file action and republish the module.</li><li>Create a solution containing all the modules with the download action, in the created solution check the option "Publish with full compilations" and publish it.</li></ol> (RPM-4534) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li> Fixed an issue that caused the Top Errors reports in Service Center > Analytics to be empty. The issue occurred on Platform Server 11.23.0 and higher and the normal behavior was restored in this version. (RPM-4835) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Adds a new feature to permanently disable calls to /ECT_Provider/WS_ECT.asmx endpoint from Reactive and Mobile apps. This can be enabled on /ECT_Provider/Configurations.aspx with the "Permanently disable App Feedback for Reactive and Mobile" checkbox. It also requires installing OutSystemsUI 2.18.5 or newer and recompiling the apps. Notice that this feature should only be enabled if you don't intend to use App Feedback on the environment for Reactive and Mobile. Traditional apps are not affected. (RPM-866) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">System Components</span> </li>
<li>Added missing descriptions to site properties of EPA_Taskbox module.  (RPM-981) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">System Components</span> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues</h3>
