<ul>
<li>It is now possible to see the site property description in the table on the Site Properties list screen.
Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/9904/service-center-description-of-site-properties-in-the-list-page/">Takasi Moriya</a> and <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/12306/display-descriptions-for-site-property-tab-in-service-center/">Raphael Laurence Reyno's ideas</a>. (R11CT-308)</li>
<li>It is now possible to filter the screens logs by User.
Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/9930/filter-by-user-on-screen-requests-log/">Luís Figueiredo's idea</a>. (R11CT-311)</li>
<li>Added support for the redaction of header and body parameters of an exposed REST API when the Logging Level is set to Full or Troubleshoot. (R11DT-1118)</li>
<li>Added the ability to deploy all modules prepared during an upgrade. It is now possible to optionally, after upgrading your OutSystems environment to Platform Server 11.18.0+ version, to immediately deploy all modules that were successfully prepared.
If executed, the "Deploy All" action will reflect all changes and improvements from the new Platform Server version in the applications running code.<br/>

We recommend that customers skip this step and instead publish modules and/or apps manually as needed. Nevertheless, for those customers/scenarios where a deploy of all upgraded applications is needed ASAP, customers now have the option to do it.<br/>

For more details about the deployment of prepared modules check <a href="documentation_link">the documentation</a>. (R11PIT-885)</li>
<li>Solution publishing was optimized and is now up to 40% faster in large factories. (R11PT-80)</li>
<li>Applies only to environments using an Oracle database.<br/>
Now, new sequences used for auto numbers created by the Platform have a cache size of 100.<br/>
When upgrading the Platform to version 11.18.0 by running the Configuration Tool, existing sequences that have no cache will be updated to have a cache size of 100. (RPM-1158) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Cloud Orchestration</span> </li>
<li>OutSystems Deployment Controller and OutSystems Scheduler Services now run with Virtual Accounts. If you have permissions errors when installing please check the following <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Troubleshooting/Service_permissions_error_when_installing_or_upgrading_to_Platform_Server_11.12.0_or_later">documentation</a>. (RPM-1334) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">OutSystems Services</span> </li>
<li>It is now possible to read and display data from PostgreSQL external databases columns with the 'Time (without TimeZone)' data type . (RPM-3043) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.18.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented some licensing errors from displaying the correct error message. (R11BRT-152)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a failed SAP connection when clicking the "Test Connection" button in Service Center. (R11DT-1452)</li>
<li>Improved performance of Pool Garbage Collector job (R11PIT-778)</li>
<li>Updated installation checklist to add information regarding the need to have "Create Symbolic Links" permission when running the configuration tool. (R11PIT-784)</li>
<li>Added disclaimers relating to the use of the "Create/Upgrade Service" in custom RabbitMQ installation scenarios in Configuration Tool and Installation Checklist. (R11PIT-807)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Service Studio to assume the wrong module version as the most recent when using Oracle RAC databases. (R11PT-24)</li>
<li>Fixed a lock while updating Site Properties on long requests. (RPM-1032) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Factory Configuration that prevented Shared Configurations from being saved and caused an error related with Administrator permissions.<br/> 
This occurred when shared configurations were associated with deleted Modules. (RPM-1175) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Supported Forge Component</span> </li>
<li>Added logs to provide additional information when deployment service fails. (RPM-1202) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">OutSystems Services</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurred after creating a foreign key that caused database locks with wait type "enq: TM – contention" and a significant increase in the database CPU usage.<br/>
This happened in environments using an Oracle database. (RPM-1609) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in LifeTime that caused deployment plans to fail due to lack of user permissions when no new reference was added. (RPM-1689) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused modules and apps to have different settings in different servers of the same Deployment Zone.<br/>
This occurred after adding more servers to a Deployment Zone and then changing settings of a module or app that was deployed before the new server was added. (RPM-1830) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a deployment to fail with an ORA-01440 error in environments using an Oracle database.<br/>
This occurred when deploying a module after decreasing the precision or scale of an entity's attribute, by changing its Data Type, or the Length or Decimals properties.<br/>
Now, compilation checks whether a change to an attribute's data type would raise the ORA-01440 error. (RPM-2042) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Service Studio to assume the wrong module version as the most recent when using Oracle RAC databases. (RPM-2220) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Deployment stage</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused different module runtime behavior depending on the Debug Mode for the module. Learn more about <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setup_and_maintain_your_OutSystems_infrastructure/Setting_Up_OutSystems/Configure_your_OutSystems_environment#environment-debug-mode">environment and module Debug Mode</a>.<br/>
This occurred in actions that included asynchronous logic and that were set as event handlers. For example, this affected the behavior of the Button Loading widget. (RPM-2269) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Improved NLS_Language tooltip's text for Extenal Databases configurations. (RPM-2398) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a bug with Download Node which caused alternative logic branches from a Client Action to be executed. (RPM-2410) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused runtime errors when authenticating users using the SAML authentication available in the Users app.<br/>
When trying to authenticate users with SAML at runtime, there were "Unable to Process Request" errors. Checking the logs in Service Center, there was an error message similar to "String or binary data would be truncated in table 'OSDev.dbo.OSUSR_6WD_SAMLMESSAGE_LOG', column 'SESSIONINDEX'. Truncated value: '_x18MaTZNE2aO1vm5_xMcXivDMh0LRTrbxS0uuDPV3SOB1261'. The statement has been terminated." Alternatively, the message might mention the MessageID column instead.<br/>
To solve this issue, the length of the SessionIndex, MessageID, and ResponseToMessageID attributes in the Users SamlMessage_Log entity was increased. (RPM-2463) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Users</span> </li>

<li>Fixed an issue that caused a wrong translation in multiple languages. This occurred in Japanese, Chinese and Dutch for the translation of "Username". (RPM-2857) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Interface</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Server API incorrectly sends the catalog Name instead of the catalog Logical Name to Service Center when publishing solutions or applications. (RPM-2860) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> </li>
