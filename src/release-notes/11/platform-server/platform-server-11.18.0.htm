<ul>
<li>It is now possible to see the site property description in the table on the eSpace_Edit screen.
Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/9904/service-center-description-of-site-properties-in-the-list-page/">Takasi Moriya and <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/12306/display-descriptions-for-site-property-tab-in-service-center//">Raphael Laurence Reyno's ideas</a>. (R11CT-308)</li>
<li>It is now possible to filter the screens logs by User.
Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/9930/filter-by-user-on-screen-requests-log/">Lu√≠s Figueiredo's idea</a>. (R11CT-311)</li>
<li>Added support for the redaction of header and body parameters of an exposed REST API when the Logging Level is set to Full or Troubleshoot. (R11DT-1118)</li>
<li>OutSystems Deployment Controller and OutSystems Scheduler Services now run with Virtual Accounts. If you have permissions errors when installing follow the documentation on https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Troubleshooting/Service_permissions_error_when_installing_or_upgrading_to_Platform_Server_11.12.0_or_later (RPM-1334) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">OutSystems Services</span> </li>
<li>It is now possible to read and display data from PostgreSQL external databases columns with the 'Time (without TimeZone)' data type . (RPM-3043) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>

<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.18.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a lock while updating Site Properties on long requests. (RPM-1032) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> </li>
<li>The parameter "OutSystems.HubEdition.OracleSequenceCacheSize" was created in the OSSYS_PARAMETER table to control Oracle sequence cache size. The default value is 100 and the acceptable range of values is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).

If the parameter does not exist, the cache size for new Oracle sequences will use the default value.
If the parameter exists and its value is less than 2, Oracle sequences will be created with "NO CACHE".
If the parameter exists and its value is greater than 1000, the cache size for new Oracle sequences will be 1000. 
If the parameter exists and its value is between 2 and 1000, the cache size for new Oracle sequences will be the parameter value.

When upgrading the database to version 11.18.0 by running the Configuration Tool, existing sequences that have no cache will be updated to have the value defined in the parameter (or the default). (RPM-1158) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Cloud Orchestration</span> </li>
<li>Deleted espaces no longer impact the ability to change shared configurations. (RPM-1175) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Supported Forge Component</span> </li>
<li>Added logs to provide additional information when deployment service fails. (RPM-1202) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">OutSystems Services</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused database locks in Oracle when a foreign key was being created. (RPM-1609) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in LifeTime that caused deployment plans to fail due to lack of user permissions when no new reference was added. (RPM-1689) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was not applying the settings to a server when the server was added to an existing zone. (RPM-1830) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>In environments using an Oracle database, compilation now checks whether a change to an attribute's type would raise the ORA-01440 error. (RPM-2042) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Service Studio to assume the wrong module version as the most recent when using Oracle RAC databases. (RPM-2220) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Deployment stage</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a difference in behavior in actions called as event handlers when the module is published with or without the option "Allow users to debug this module". (RPM-2269) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Improved NLS_Language tooltip's text for Extenal Databases configurations. (RPM-2398) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a bug with Download Node which caused alternative logic branches from a Client Action to be executed. (RPM-2410) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that cause incorrect extension files being copied from producer to consumer during a solution publish. (RPM-2429) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused runtime errors when authenticating users using the SAML authentication available in the Users app.<br/>
When trying to authenticate users with SAML at runtime, there were "Unable to Process Request" errors. Checking the logs in Service Center, there was an error message similar to "String or binary data would be truncated in table 'OSDev.dbo.OSUSR_6WD_SAMLMESSAGE_LOG', column 'SESSIONINDEX'. Truncated value: '_x18MaTZNE2aO1vm5_xMcXivDMh0LRTrbxS0uuDPV3SOB1261'. The statement has been terminated." Alternatively, the message might mention the MessageID column instead.<br/>
To solve this issue, the length of the SessionIndex, MessageID, and ResponseToMessageID attributes in the Users SamlMessage_Log entity was increased. (RPM-2463) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Users</span> </li>

<li>Improved telemetry collection for Progressive Upgrade errors (RPM-2889) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented customers from proceeding with an ongoing upgrade due to an unusual longer initialization of Compiler service. (RPM-3126) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in SynchronizeDomainUsers action that was causing it to fail if a given user that was set as active in the Platform did not exist in Active Directory. (RPM-477) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Authentication and Authorization</span> </li>
