<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak on BaseViewController. (R11DT-1033)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented Screen Aggregates or Screen Data Actions to not finish when multiple existed in the same screen. (R11DT-1038)</li>

<li>After investigating the issue we found that we have a mechanism to delete the Ossys_Visit entries that is managed by the parameter OutSystems.HubEdition.DisableMetricsCollect(it must be false).

The delete action is:

DELETE FROM {Visit} WHERE {Visit}.[Instant] < @Date

<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The customer is reporting slowness while doing debug on a specific screen from a Traditional Web Application. The slowness happens during the step of changing the current action (Step Over or Step Into) is taking a lot to be completed.

<b>Added visibility of errors that occur during the log rotation operation of the Deployment Controller service. The correct status can now be seen in the Environment Health page of Service Center.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
Service Center does not show any logs after the platform weekly log rotation but there is no warning or error visibility on the services status in the Environment Health page.

Errors could still be found on the Event Viewer logs of the Controller machine.

<b>Fixed an issue that could cause an old version of a producer DLL to be installed in a consumer module when running a solution publish containing that consumer.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> <br/>

<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
Solution Publish that doesn't contain all consumer modules of producer that previously had a casing rename may cause DLL Hell problems.

<b>The application config file now does not contain some platform settings when they have the default value.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
*Symptoms*

Loading the modules at startup is using a lot of memory.

In O10 for each setting of each module would be fetched on demand from the database, leading to performance and concurrency issues. It also prevented factory managers to understand and have control on when would modules would be affected by configuration changes.

On O11 design there is a trade-off of memory for performance to load all these settings to memory for all modules from file configurations, which has a significant impact on the customer's memory usage in some scenarios.

 *How to reproduce*

It can be reproduced for modules with a high number of platform settings.

Symptoms
Outsystems applications aren't able to use URL redirection when trying to open local applications using a specific mapped protocol via browser (e.g. servicestudio://). The application always adds the scheme and host info prior to the desired URL and it ends on a 404 - Page not found error.

How to reproduce
1. Enable setting HTTPtoHTTPSproxyHeader
2. Try to use URL redirection in an URL that contains parameters separated by space (consider a non well formed URL)
