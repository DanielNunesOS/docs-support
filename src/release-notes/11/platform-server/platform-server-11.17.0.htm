<b>Fixed an issue that prevented customers from publishing some solutions in OutSystems Cloud environments due to lack of security privileges.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
Cloud customers with solutions including CloudConnectAgent components aren’t able to publish them, since they don’t have permissions to publish such components.

<b>Fixed an issue in JSON Serialize Client Action causing variables to be incorrectly serialized with the default value when the property "Serialize Default Values" was set to No.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The JSON Serialize Client Action behavior was not consistent with the JSON Serialize Server Action, as it was incorrectly serializing variables with the default value when the property "Serialize Default Values" was set to No. This would happen in the following scenarios:
<ul>
<li>Nested Structures having the default value for all attributes were serialized as an empty object instead of ignored</li>
<li>Empty Lists were serialized instead of ignored</li>
<li>Boolean attributes with True as default value were serialized instead of ignored</li>
<li>Default values on Lists were serialized as null instead of the default value</li>
</ul>

<b>Improved the Debugger performance when debugging applications containing complex variables.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Debugger</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The customer is reporting slowness while doing debug on a specific screen from a Traditional Web Application. The slowness happens during the step of changing the current action (Step Over or Step Into) is taking a lot to be completed.

<p>
<a id="RPM-1728"><strong>RPM-1728</strong></a><br/>
<b>Added visibility of errors that occur during the log rotation operation of the Deployment Controller service. The correct status can now be seen in the Environment Health page of Service Center.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
Service Center does not show any logs after the platform weekly log rotation but there is no warning or error visibility on the services status in the Environment Health page.

Errors could still be found on the Event Viewer logs of the Controller machine.

<b>Fixed an issue that could cause an old version of a producer DLL to be installed in a consumer module when running a solution publish containing that consumer.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
Solution Publish that doesn't contain all consumer modules of producer that previously had a casing rename may cause DLL Hell problems.

<b>The application config file now does not contain some platform settings when they have the default value.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
*Symptoms*

Loading the modules at startup is using a lot of memory.

In O10 for each setting of each module would be fetched on demand from the database, leading to performance and concurrency issues. It also prevented factory managers to understand and have control on when would modules would be affected by configuration changes.

On O11 design there is a trade-off of memory for performance to load all these settings to memory for all modules from file configurations, which has a significant impact on the customer's memory usage in some scenarios.

 *How to reproduce*

It can be reproduced for modules with a high number of platform settings.

<b>Improved the description of the action HumanActivity_AssignToUser of BPT API.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Processes</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The BPT API documentation regarding the HumanActivity_AssignToUser action is missing the information that calling this action will transition the activity to the Ready state.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-2175"><strong>RPM-2175</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue that caused a human activity to be reopened when the ActivityReset action was used with the setting ResetActivityUser input as True.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Processes</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The ActivityReset action from (System) does not validate if activities are already Closed or Terminated. This can lead for the action to be used to reopen closed human activities. The problem only happens when setting the ResetActivityUser input as True.

<b>Updated Newtonsoft.Json library bundled with the platform from version 12.0.3 to version 13.0.1.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
A new version NewtonSoft.Json (13.0.0.1) includes a security fix that can prevent DOS attacks from being exploited by reducing the limit of depth of structures being serialized. Currently there is no known attack vector to exploit this on the OutSystems Platform as the problematic patterns are not used by default.

Note that custom extensions that reuse the NewtonSoft.Json library can exercise the problematic patterns.
