<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the correct functionality of effective user provider feature when using Redis. (R11BRT-435)</li>

<li>It's now possible to override the default logic used to determine how connections are authenticated against LDAP servers for End-Users and IT users, by configuring a Site Property in Users or LDAPAuthProvider modules, respectively. This can be used to allow integration with servers using particular setups. (RPM-2987) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Authentication and Authorization</span> </li>
<li>Fixed compilation on Service Studio by disallowing Service Actions to have inputs or outputs Default Values pointing to a Static Record Id. (RPM-332) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the error "Could not obtain the value for â€˜[key]' Site Property. Please republish the eSpace.". This was caused after publishing a module where a new reference has been added to another module of type Library. The calculation of dependencies was selecting the wrong version during the first publication and, due to this, the referenced site properties were not being published. (RPM-3955) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> </li>
<li>Updated Open-Source projects Licenses and Copyrights used in the Platform (RPM-3978) <span class="cattag">Mobile Apps Builder</span> </li>

This occurred when IIS was configured to not allow unknown file extensions. (RPM-668) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Added a site property on the NativeAppBuilder system component named NativeBuildHostnameOverride to specify the download location of the .ipa file when using the QRCode on native mobile apps on advanced network configuration scenarios. The default value is empty, and it allows for port specification. (RPM-1137) (RPM-861) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">System Components</span> </li>
<li>Upgraded the usage of BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll 1.8.6.1 in System Components to BouncyCastle.Cryptography.dll 2.2.0 - CVSS score 5.9 (Medium).

Customers using MySQL as a third-party database or custom extensions that rely on BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll may still be vulnerable. (RPM-1099) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a vulnerability that would allow an attacker to perform SSRF and port scanning attacks. CVSS Score 4.1 (Medium). (RPM-3846) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
