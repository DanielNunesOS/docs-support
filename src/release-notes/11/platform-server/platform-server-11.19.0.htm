<ul>
<li>Query at DBCompilerServiceOracle.GetVeryLargeProcesses had a performance improvement, by adding a filter over the OSSYS_BPM_ACTIVITY table (R11BRT-179)</li>
<li>Added support for MySQL 8.0 (8.0.28 or later within the 8.0 version, all editions) as an external database. (R11BRT-208)</li>
<li>Improved the confirmation message in Service Center when saving and applying the environment security settings. (R11CT-1698)</li>
<li>It is now possible to remove previous versions of the Hosting Bundle pre-requisite, during the installation of the Platform Server with a new Hosting Bundle version, by adding a new flag to the installer. (R11PIT-846)</li>
<li>The Deploy All process was optimized to follow the strategy used in Solution Publish. It now consists in two phases: in the first phase everything is readied for the deployment of all included modules and in the second phase the modules are actually deployed. This minimizes the time window where some modules are compiled and deployed using the latest platform improvements and others are still in the process of being deployed. (R11PIT-863)</li>
<li>Expose REST web services using the PATCH verb capability is now available. This was previously in technical preview but is now available for everyone. (RO11IT-26)</li>
<li>Improved the error handling mechanism on the ApplicationSwitcher to reduce the impact on applications where it's used. (ROU-4016)</li>
