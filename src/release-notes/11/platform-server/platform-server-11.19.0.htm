<h2 id="platform_server_11.19.0" >Platform Server 11.19.0</h2> 
<div class="info"><p>Released on Feb 20, 2023</p></div>


<style>.cattag {background: #f4f2ff; color: #6a6581; padding: 4px 10px;}</style>
<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_11.19.0" >New in Platform Server 11.19.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for MySQL 8.0 (8.0.28 or later within the 8.0 version, all editions) as an external database. (R11BRT-208)</li>
<li>Improved the confirmation message in Service Center when saving and applying the environment security settings. (R11CT-1698)</li>
<li>Now, for OutSystems Cloud infrastructures, the Environment Security page will have the options disabled and not just the Save buttons.<br/>
Now, for environments managed by LifeTime, the Environment Security page will have the Save buttons disabled and not just the options. (R11CT-1868)</li>
<li>Added the ability to deploy all modules prepared during an upgrade. It is now possible to optionally, after upgrading your OutSystems environment to Platform Server 11.19.0 or higher, to immediately deploy all modules that were successfully prepared.
If executed, the "Deploy All" action will reflect all changes and improvements from the new Platform Server version in the applications running code.<br/>

We recommend that customers skip this step and instead publish modules and/or apps manually as needed. Nevertheless, for those customers/scenarios where a deploy of all upgraded applications is needed as soon as possible, customers now have the option to do it.<br/>

For more details about the deployment of prepared modules check <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setup_and_maintain_your_OutSystems_infrastructure/Upgrade_OutSystems_platform/Modules_deployment_step_during_Platform_Server_upgrade">the documentation</a>. (R11PIT-973)</li>
<li>Consuming REST services using multipart or form-data as request format. 

Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/5022/rest-native-support-of-multipart-form-data/">Kilian Hekhuis's idea</a>. (RO11IT-226)</li>
<li>Expose REST web services using the PATCH verb capability is now available. This was previously in technical preview but is now available for everyone. (RO11IT-26)</li>
<li>Improved the error handling mechanism on the ApplicationSwitcher to reduce the impact on applications where it's used. (ROU-4016)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.19.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>

<li>Fixed an issue that caused dummy Modules deployment operation to be started when running Configuration Tool in unattended mode with the /DeployPreparedApplications parameter. Now, if there are no modules previously prepared, deploy will be skipped. (R11PIT-950)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Service Center Upgrades Page to display a wrong “from version” value in the heading, under the "Upgrades" title. (R11PIT-961)</li>

<li>Fixed bug in General Logs with SOAP Consumed services identified as Exposed when changing the configuration with Service Center. (RO11IT-204)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an empty Queries Performance report when at least one module with SLOWSQL logs has the name starting with 'MS'. (RPM-1151) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Service Center log filters that prevented the user from filtering them when using Internet Explorer browser. (RPM-1218) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a bug when importing a SOAP web service with choices that have elements in non-alphabetical order (RPM-1222) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused multi-tenant timers and timers from multi-tenant eSpaces to still be displayed after the eSpaces are deleted. (RPM-1358) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Now, users with Access or List as the default role and Monitor and Add Dependencies as the team/applications role can view logs for the applications that they are assigned with Monitor and Add Dependencies. (RPM-1553) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>

<li>In Reactive Web or Mobile apps, users were redirected to a blank page when a Site Rule with the environment’s hostname was pointing directly to a Reactive web app's endpoint.
Due to this issue, when the users tried to access the endpoint, they had to refresh the page in order for it to properly render.
Now, the users are no longer redirected to a blank page and, hence, there is no need to refresh the page. (RPM-2160) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Interface</span> </li>

This occurred in the Service Center's Module Edit page in the Single Sign On tab.

<h3>Breaking change</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a module references (directly or indirectly) multiple extensions and those extensions contain different versions of the same DLL, the Solution Publish process can now choose a different DLL than in previous versions. This can cause applications to stop working correctly. Check more detail on how to deal with this breaking change <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/release_notes/11/outsystems_11_side_effects_and_breaking_changes/#bc-11190-1">here</a>.</li>
