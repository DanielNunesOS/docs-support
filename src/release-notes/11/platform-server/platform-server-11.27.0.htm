<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_11.27.0" >New in Platform Server 11.27.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the installer to correctly cleanup files related to containers hosting technologies functionality that was previously removed in Platform Server 11.23.0 (R11BRT-436)</li>
<li>Platform Server now detects unsupported versions for Oracle databases. When running Configuration Tool or creating an external database connection in Service Center, a warning now appears when creating a connection to an unsupported database version. (R11BRT-783)</li>
<li>Upgraded Swashbuckle.AspNetCore to version 6.5.0. It includes multiple security vulnerability fixes introduced by those versions. This change only affects Server.API, Server.Identity system applications and OutSystems services. (R11BRT-838)</li>
<li>Upgraded Microsoft.AspNetCore libraries and dependencies to the latest 2.1.x versions available. It includes multiple security vulnerability fixes introduced by those versions. This change only affects Server.API and Server.Identity system applications. (R11BRT-839)</li>
<li>Upgraded the third-party component HtmlSanitizer, used in Sanitization System Extension, to version 8.0.838. This new version includes multiple security vulnerability fixes. (R11BRT-840)</li>
<li>Simplified https certificate validations on Deployment Zones Test Configuration to prevent warnings in situations involving valid Intermediate CA certificates that were issued without or unreachable CRL endpoints. (R11BRT-842)</li>
<li>RabbitMQ was upgraded to version 3.13.0. Erlang was upgraded to version 26.2.2. (R11BRT-873)</li>
<li>It is now possible to view all available logs on the Grouped Request page of Service Center, when Log Separation feature is enabled. (R11PST-107)</li>
<li>Enabled by default the Solution Publish parameter "Refresh only broken dependencies". When enabled, this setting sets the publication operation to refresh the dependencies in a consumer module only if there are incompatible signatures in the referenced elements, during the update components step. To revert to the old behaviour, please install Factory Configuration with version 11.2.0 or higher and uncheck the option “Refresh only broken dependencies in solution publish”. Check <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/release_notes/11/outsystems_11_side_effects_and_breaking_changes/">OutSystems 11 side effects and breaking changes</a> for more details. (R11PST-33)</li>
<li>It is now possible to configure via Factory Configuration (Security section: Remove nr2 cookie username) the removal of the user's username from the nr2<User Provider Name> cookie.
To enable this fix, please install Factory Configuration 11.2.0. (RPM-1454) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Cookies</span> </li>
<li>It is now possible to seamlessly configure PingFederate as an external identity provider within the OutSystems platform. This empowers users to experience a streamlined Single Sign-On process across various OutSystems ecosystem tools, all facilitated by PingFederate. (RPM-4057) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.27.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Upgrades>Deployment screen that whenever an error occurred in the deployment process. The Service Center screen would not update and you could only see the progress updates and errors after refreshing the page. (R11BRT-811)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Configuration Tool that caused outdated procedures from OutSystems 10 to be left in the database as invalid objects.
This issue occurs when a OutSystems Platform using Oracle is upgraded from OutSystems 10 to OutSystems 11.
Now, procedures are properly deleted. (R11BRT-846)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an error “Sequence contains no matching element” when publishing a solution. (R11PST-147)</li>
<li>Fixed a virtualization misbehavior where some items from a List (Reactive/Mobile) were not rendered. This issue is only visible in lists where items stack vertically, in more than one column. After scrolling up and down, one might detect some items are not visible. To enable this fix, please install Factory Configuration 11.2.0 and check the option "Enable alternative list virtualization mechanism in Mobile/Reactive". Be aware that this fix might not cover every single scenario such as when resizing a browser window or when the List layout can change dynamically. (RPM-1232) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Interface</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a concurrency issue that caused an "invalid compiler output" error during Lifetime stagings due to an early variable assignment. (RPM-1800) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed the translations in the Input_Calendar component for the Japanese language.
Fixed the translations in the List_Counter component for the German language. (RPM-2009) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">System Components</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that would trigger a database exception when cleaning up closed activities.
This issue occurred for infrastructures with Oracle database provider and over 1000 activities.
Now the cleanup will proceed as expected regardless of the provider and number of records to clean up. (RPM-3233) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented registered users from submitting feedback through AppFeedback (ECT_Provider). The AppFeedback pop-up balloon was not visible when the site property AllowAnonymousFeedback was set to False and the user was logged in. This applies to Traditional apps only. (RPM-3319) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>When attempting to publish all consumers of a producer module, an error occurred if the user lacked the appropriate permissions. Now, if the user lacks the necessary permissions, the button that starts the operation is disabled. (RPM-3345) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Server.API and Server.Identity that caused high memory usage due to leftover processes.

This issue was introduced with the usage of Microsoft .Net Windows Server Hosting version 6.0 and to fix it we upgraded the required Microsoft .Net Windows Server Hosting from version 6.0 to 8.0. (RPM-3940) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Server.API</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the Configuration Tool to report the wrong Hosting Bundle version when validating the installation. (RPM-4074) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> </li>
<li>Clicking outside an open Popover Widget no longer stops event propagation. Before this fix, the first click outside an open Popover on a link or other interactive element did nothing but close the Popover. Now, clicking an element outside an open popover closes the popover and produces the expected result on the clicked element. (RPM-4085) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Interface</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an accessibility inconvenience where elements inside a popover widget (Reactive/Mobile) were not focused by default after opening it. The first focusable element (input, button, textarea, select, or link) is now focused right after opening a popover widget. (RPM-4520) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Interface</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Deploy All to silently skip some modules.
This occurred due to a concurrency problem with the retrying mechanism in Deploy Service that is responsible for deploying pending modules. This mechanism would cause some of the prepared modules to skip the Deployment stage of the Deploy All operation. These skipped modules would only be deployed later by this same retrying mechanism automatically. (RPM-4545) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Deployment stage</span> </li>
<li>Implemented an alternative regex for Traditional Page Rules that ensures the URL Pattern matches exactly. The default regex for the URL Pattern "/test123" matches "/test123456" and a request to that URL would return 200. The alternative regex will not match and return 404. 
This new feature is disabled by default and can be enabled in Factory Configuration (Runtime section: "Match exact Page Rules URL pattern"). After enabling the option, one needs to access the Page Rules in Service Center and click Save.
To enable this fix, please install Factory Configuration 11.2.0. (RPM-4602) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">SEO Friendly URLs</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a bug in Reactive/Mobile applications that prevented triggering an Event from a Producer module that was exposed and consumed by a Consumer module. This occurred when the Producer event was renamed and published, and after publishing the Consumer without refreshing the dependencies. (RPM-4623) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Interface</span> </li>
<li>Improved the error message during solution publish when there are multiple modules or extensions with the same key. (RPM-4633) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a key not found error when publishing an application or solution.
This occurred in the "Associating dependencies" step. (RPM-4685) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue where prepared deployment plans could get aborted inadvertently. This was caused by an asynchronous maintenance process on the target environment that would delete the solution with the applications getting staged. Now, the maintenance operation deletes solutions only if they are older than 96 hours. As such, deployment plans won't get aborted, unless they are not finalized within 4 days. (RPM-4690) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue when bootstrapping data from an excel file saved with the Strict Open XML format. This fix implies a breaking change. Check <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/release_notes/11/outsystems_11_side_effects_and_breaking_changes/">OutSystems 11 side effects and breaking changes</a> for more details. (RPM-4715) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Upgraded IdentityModel libraries to version 7.3.0.
It includes multiple security vulnerability fixes introduced by those libraries. (RPM-4751) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Module References</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented IT users from accessing applications in Service Center and logging in to AI Mentor Studio. Typically this issue occurred when using an email as username claim while setting up OIDC, but it could occur in other scenarios. With this fix users can use any type of claim as username claim and can access the application and login to AI mentor studio. (RPM-4752) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue opening ConfigurationTool that caused a login attempt with an empty password when using Windows Authentication. This could cause, depending on domain policies, the user to be blocked. (RPM-4771) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> </li>
<li>Fixed Deployment Zones Test Configuration screen to use the current inputs information instead of the last saved values. This also fixes the errors that would happen when Test Configuration was used in the Create Deployment Zone screen. (RPM-4818) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Updated installation checklist for LifeTime platform service installation scenario, ensuring compatibility with Windows Authentication used in the database authentication mechanism. (RPM-674) <span class="cattag">Platform Installation</span>  <span class="cattag">Checklist</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented AppFeedback from functioning in Traditional Web modules that have a different user provider than Users. Now, any module can submit feedback through AppFeedback independently of the user provider used. This applies only to Traditional Web apps. (RPM-748) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">App Feedback Backoffice / ECT</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a security issue that led to a XSS vulnerability in the Users application when Azure AD, OKTA or SAML 2.0 authentication methods were used. CVSSv3.1 score 4.7 (Medium). (RPM-4785) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Users</span> </li>
</ul>
