<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where linking to a screen with a custom URL defined caused a crash if mandatory inputs were empty or invalid.  (RAR-782)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on progressive web apps (PWAs) where data from an aggregate populated by local storage did not display. This issue occurred when a consuming module used a different entity name than the producer module. (RPM-896)</li>
<li>Raised the required Microsoft .NET Core Windows Server Hosting from 2.1 to 3.1. The checklist and documentation instruction links have been updated to reflect this. (RPM-1105)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Multilingual Locales that caused the following error message to display: "Problem fetching the current Locale. The returned Locale is either null or undefined." (RPM-1161)</li>
<li>For a REST Expose Action, the swagger.json file now correctly reflects the "Name in Response" value when you specify that the output parameter must 
be sent in the header. Previously, the "Name in Response" was ignored when specified for the output parameter.  (RPM-1181)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that removed page rules of Traditional Web applications when they were republished. (RPM-1324)</li>
<li>Fixed a performance issue with compiling modules. The fix reduces the number of database queries required when computing server-to-client data transfer optimization. (RTAF-4754)</li>
<li>Fixed a performance issue with SQL Server by eliminating unnecessary executions of the SERVERPROPERTY function. (RPLAT-650)</li>

<li>When browsing application edit screens, Service Center no longer redirects you to the home page after a period of inactivity. (R11PIT-177)</li>

<li>We fixed an error in Reactive Web Apps, in environments with the technical preview "SEO-friendly URLs for
Reactive Web Apps". An error occurred when users accessed Screens that contain a Custom URL and an empty 
Page Name value or a Screen Name value equal to the Page Name value. This naming limitation no longer exists. (RTAF-4618)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue causing 404 errors in Reactive Web Apps. Screens configured with path parameters had 404 
errors after upgrading an application.  (RTAF-4646)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where application runtime errors could occur under high concurrency conditions. This occurred with Static Entities defined in Libraries or when modules referenced Static Entities defined in Libraries. (RPLAT-751)</li>
