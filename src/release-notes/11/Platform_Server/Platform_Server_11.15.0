BPT processes (on trigger of a record creation) are not launched for tenants that are not the default one.

*How to reproduce*
1. Create a simple app with an entity and a process that is launched with the insert of records in the entity;
2. Change the eSpace and the entity to multitenant;
3. Create a new tenant and a new user for that tenant;
4. Login in the app with the user of the default tenant (e.g., tenant 20 of Users) and with the user of the new tenant;
5. Create the record with each of the users;
6. The BPT is launched for the user of the default tenant and not for the user of the new tenant.</p><p><a id="RPM-1441"><strong>RPM-1441</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused records to be deleted from ossys_modulefrontend, if duplicates were found, when upgrading to PS 11.12.2 or later</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>*Symptoms*
When pressing the Create/upgrade database button in the Configuration Tool (Platform and Log tabs), a query will run if there are duplicated rows in the "ossys_modulefrontend" table, erasing everything in it.

*How to reproduce*
One way to reproduce this is to perform an update to version 11.12.2 (Build 31091) and make sure that there are duplicates in the ossys_modulefrontend table.</p><p><a id="RPM-1551"><strong>RPM-1551</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused the 1-Click Publish to fail with an error "Invalid compiler output.

The scheduler service is pulling work always in the same order, by sandbox name. This means that if the first sandbox in the front-end creates a lot of async processes, the async processes from the other boxes will not be processed.

This would happen in the following scenarios:
- Having an Integer or Long Integer type with a Decimal, Boolean or Identifier value;
- Having a DateTime type with a Date or Time value;
- Having a Date type with a DateTime value;
- Having a Time type with a DateTime value.
An error could also happen while compiling a module containing a Static Entity with a Long Integer type and a Boolean value, without the need to actually reference it.</p><p><a id="RPM-1715"><strong>RPM-1715</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue on the autocomplete that wasn't working properly when used on a text area (Richwidgets).</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">System Components</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>*Symptoms*
Values from Input_AutoComplete widget are not selectable when the input widget has properties Max. Length value and Text Lines is higher than 1

*How to reproduce*
Configure an Input_AutoComplete widget with an input widget that has properties Max. Length value of 50 and Text Lines is 2 or higher.</p><p><a id="RPM-1876"><strong>RPM-1876</strong></a><br><b>Fixed a bug that lead to runtime errors when an attribute was added to a multi-tenant entity and the publication of the corresponding change was aborted during the execution of the DB scripts.

When a Light Event reaches the default timeout, 180s, the request in IIS is not aborted. After some time, when a new attempt is made to run the LBPT, we can see the new request showing up in IIS. The original request will only disappear from the pool after 300s, which is the default timeout of normal BPTs.

*How to reproduce*
Create a BPT process and configure it as a light event;
Place a sleep to force the timeout of the event;
The request is logged as timeout on the Error logs after 180s but continues to execute until the 300s;
It also retries the activity while the 1st instance is still running on IIS;
All of this is visible on the IIS worker process;</p><p><a id="RPM-2061"><strong>RPM-2061</strong></a><br><b>Improved the Tuning and Security section of the checklist</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Installation Checklist</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>*Symptoms*
