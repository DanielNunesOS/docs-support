When pressing the Create/upgrade database button in the Configuration Tool (Platform and Log tabs), a query will run if there are duplicated rows in the "ossys_modulefrontend" table, erasing everything in it.

*How to reproduce*
One way to reproduce this is to perform an update to version 11.12.2 (Build 31091) and make sure that there are duplicates in the ossys_modulefrontend table.</p><p><a id="RPM-1551"><strong>RPM-1551</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused the 1-Click Publish to fail with an error "Invalid compiler output.

One environment with heavy Processes usage may cause database contention and accumulation of the Activities to process. In this situation, other environments may experience starvation of the Scheduler Service, namely, Process Activities are queued and stay in “Created” state for a long time.</p><p><a id="RPM-1653"><strong>RPM-1653</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused the 1-Click Publish to fail with a compilation error when publishing a module that references a Static Entity which has an Attribute value that needs an implicit conversion to match the defined type. </b><br><span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>When referencing a Static Entity which has an Attribute value that needs an implicit conversion to match the defined type, the consumer module would fail to compile. This would happen in the following scenarios:
<ul>
<li>Having an Integer or Long Integer type with a Decimal, Boolean or Identifier value</li>
<li>Having a DateTime type with a Date or Time value</li>
<li>Having a Date type with a DateTime value</li>
<li>Having a Time type with a DateTime value</li>
</ul>
An error could also happen while compiling a module containing a Static Entity with a Long Integer type and a Boolean value, without the need to actually reference it.</p><p><a id="RPM-1715"><strong>RPM-1715</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue in the Input_AutoComplete widget of RichWidgets when used with a text widget under specific conditions. Applies only to Traditional Web apps.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">System Components</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>In Traditional Web apps, using an Input_AutoComplete widget of RichWidget with a text widget, such as the Input widget, that has a Max. Length value and the Text Lines property is greater than 1, causes an error when selecting the value from the Input_AutoComplete widget.</p><p><a id="RPM-1876"><strong>RPM-1876</strong></a><br><b>Fixed a runtime error that occurred when adding or deleting attributes to a multi-tenant Entity and the publishing of the corresponding change is aborted during the execution of the DB scripts.

In this situation, the multi-tenant views are not updated, causing ORA-00904 errors in runtime.</p><p><a id="RPM-1934"><strong>RPM-1934</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused the application publishing operation to hang when the application definitions in the database are in an invalid state.</b><br><span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>This issue causes the application publishing operation to hang in step "Creating Application" with no errors being returned, and the application pool stops working.</p><p><a id="RPM-1980"><strong>RPM-1980</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused the Scheduler to timeout earlier than expected when running light BPT automatic processes.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Processes</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>*Symptoms*
When a Light Event reaches the default timeout, 180s, the request in IIS is not aborted. After some time, when a new attempt is made to run the LBPT, we can see the new request showing up in IIS. The original request will only disappear from the pool after 300s, which is the default timeout of normal BPTs.

*How to reproduce*
Create a BPT process and configure it as a light event;
Place a sleep to force the timeout of the event;
The request is logged as timeout on the Error logs after 180s but continues to execute until the 300s;
It also retries the activity while the 1st instance is still running on IIS;
All of this is visible on the IIS worker process;</p><p><a id="RPM-2061"><strong>RPM-2061</strong></a><br><b>Improved the Tuning and Security section of the checklist</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Installation Checklist</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>*Symptoms*
