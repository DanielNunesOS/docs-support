<h3>New in Platform Server 11.14.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>When using Active Directory for IT users authentication, login can be slow requiring users to belong to specific AD groups and the Active Directory contains a significant number of groups. The groups associated with users can now be cached, speeding up the login process. The cache duration is controlled by Site Property CacheInMinutesForActiveDirectoryGroups from ADAuthProvider module. By default it is 0 (cache is turned off). (RPM-1977)</li>
