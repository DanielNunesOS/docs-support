<h3>New in Platform Server 11.14.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>While using LDAP authentication, especially when using the LDAPS protocol, connections to some servers can be slow, because the connection is only made by using a fallback mechanism. If for every call to LDAP Action in Authentication extension, there's a "Fallback to use user domain" message in the platform logs, you environment might be experiencing this.
The ossys_parameter `OutSystems.Authentication.LDAPTryUsernameDomainFirst` can be set to `True` to switch the connection logic, making this fallback mechanism be tried first, improving performance. (RPM-1942)</li>
<li>When using Active Directory for IT users authentication, login can be slow requiring users to belong to specific AD groups and the Active Directory contains a significant number of groups. The groups associated with users can now be cached, speeding up the login process. The cache duration is controlled by Site Property CacheInMinutesForActiveDirectoryGroups from ADAuthProvider module. By default it is 0 (cache is turned off). (RPM-1977)</li>
</ul>
