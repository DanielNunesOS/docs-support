<h3>New in Platform Server 11.14.1</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Support/Release_Notes/11/Platform_Server/Platform_Server_11.14.1#RPM-1942"rel="custom">While using LDAP authentication, especially when using the LDAPS protocol, connections to some servers can be slow, because the connection is only made by using a fallback mechanism. If for every call to LDAP Action in Authentication extension, there's a "Fallback to use user domain" message in the platform logs, you environment might be experiencing this.
The ossys_parameter `OutSystems.Authentication.LDAPTryUsernameDomainFirst` can be set to `True` to switch the connection logic, making this fallback mechanism be tried first, improving performance. (RPM-1942)</a></li>
<li><a href="/Support/Release_Notes/11/Platform_Server/Platform_Server_11.14.1#RPM-1977"rel="custom">When using Active Directory for IT users authentication, login can be slow requiring users to belong to specific AD groups and the Active Directory contains a significant number of groups. The groups associated with users can now be cached, speeding up the login process. The cache duration is controlled by Site Property CacheInMinutesForActiveDirectoryGroups from ADAuthProvider module. By default it is 0 (cache is turned off). (RPM-1977)</a></li>

“Single Sign-On Between App Types” is enabled on Service Center, but the sessions are not synchronized between application types.
For example: session is lost on Traditional Web applications but not on Reactive applications (or vice-versa).

*How to reproduce*
1. Enable “Single Sign-On Between App Types” on Service Center;
2. Access a Traditional application on a separate window or tab
3. Login on the application
4. Navigate to a screen unaccessible to anonymous users
5. Access a Reactive application on a separate window or tab
6. Navigate to a screen unaccessible to anonymous users
7. Wait 20 to 30 minutes (using the default values of “Max Idle Timeout” from IIS and Service Center, if your values were customized then replace with those values)
8. Refresh both screens
9. Session was lost on one application but not on the other</p><p><a id="RPM-1440"><strong>RPM-1440</strong></a><br><b>Fixed the error "ORA-00911: invalid character", in Configuration Tool, when create/upgrade platform or log database.

While upgrading the environment from platform version 11.0.606.0 to version 11.12.2 (Build 31091), the customer faced the following error when pressing the Create/upgrade database (platform and log tabs):

"ORA-00911: invalid character"

*How to reproduce*
- In an environment with Platform version 11.0.606.0 installed, follow the steps to update to version 11.12.2 (Build 31091);
- Make sure that the "Ossys_ModuleFrontend" table has duplicates;
- After running the Configuration Tool and pressing the Create/upgrade database button in the Platform tab, the reported error will occur.</p><p><a id="RPM-1469"><strong>RPM-1469</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that was causing System Components installation to fail during upgrades on Pure Deployment Controller Farm scenarios</b><br><span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Installer</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>*Symptoms*
During an upgrade in a Pure Deployment Controller Scenario (where only Deployment Controller Service is enabled in that machine), we are unable to install System Components

When doing a *logout* operation, the user sometimes is redirected to IIS default page (if on-premises) or ServiceCenter (if in our Cloud PaaS).
This happens intermittently and some browsers seem more susceptible to this issue.
E.g., the behaviour was never reproduced on Firefox but happens with some frequency in Chrome.

*How to reproduce*
1. Navigate to a screen that requires a registered user
2. Login
3. Wait a few minutes (2m should suffice)
4. Logout

If the issue reproduces you will be redirected to either IIS or Service Center instead of being redirected to the IdP's login screen.
This was tested using a Reactive application, unsure at this point if the issue only occurs for reactive applications.

After upgrading from JAVA to the .NET O10 version, calls to LDAP Actions from the Authentication extension will be much slower. This happens when using the LDAPS protocol.
Every call to a LDAP Action will have associated an entry about "Fallback to use user domain" in the logs.

*How to reproduce*

This problem happens when using LDAPS normally. It depends on the kind of external LDAP server and its configurations, so it might not happen in a give factory, If it happens, it should occur consistently.</p><p><a id="RPM-1977"><strong>RPM-1977</strong></a><br><b>When using Active Directory for IT users authentication, login can be slow requiring users to belong to specific AD groups and the Active Directory contains a significant number of groups.

When using Active Directory for IT users authentication, login is very slow. This affects access to tools such as Service Studio, etc.
In particular, this happens when AD authentication is configured to require users to belong to specific AD group(s). This can also produce entries about slow executions of Authentication.ActiveDirectory_GetAccountGroups in the Extension logs.

*How to reproduce*
Use Active Directory for IT users authentication, configured to require users to belong to specific AD group(s). If the AD has a large number of groups, the login to tools such as Service Studio, etc. will be abnormally slow.</p><p><a id="RPM-1997"><strong>RPM-1997</strong></a><br><b>Major upgrades from O10 to O11 no longer fail during the preparation of System Components dependencies during the upgrade operation.</b><br><span class="cattag">Platform Installation</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>During a major upgrade from O10 to O11, the system components installation can fail during the System Components dependencies preparation phase.
