<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Aggregates created using natural language to include entities that can't be used in Aggregates. This occurred even if those entities were not mentioned in the sentence. (RAID-1702)</li>
<li>Fixed the position of the interaction button in the Debugger rows. (RMAC-10088)</li>
<li>Improved the message shown on Aggregates when all attributes are hidden so that is distinguishable from the cases where there are no records to shown. (RMAC-10381)</li>
<li>Removed unnecessary empty lines from the Tooltips shown on Assign nodes.  (RMAC-10639)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Merge editor that caused a crash during item selection if module versions had different links in a flow. (RMAC-10690)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the user from copying multiple buttons at once. (RMAC-10713)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a module to be marked as changed when canceling a source rename in an aggregate. (RMAC-10718)</li>
<li>Fix issues with properties being readonly. (RMAC-10732)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused new text to be created at the bottom of the screens. (RMAC-10738)</li>
<li>Fixed the source picker in the sort tab of grouped Aggregates to only allow picking grouped attributes. (RMAC-10753)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented widgets to be selected through their adorner inside a Tabs widget. (RMAC-10762)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an incorrect behavior when double clicking Placeholders in a Screen or Block.
The double click was not navigating to the Placeholder's parent Block and when typing after that, the text was being added in the bottom of the Screen.
Now, the double click correctly navigates to the Placeholder's parent Block. (RMAC-10775)</li>
</ul>
