<ul>
<li>Improved Code Mentor logic suggestions to open or select the most likely property to be edited. Picking an Assign node now opens the Select Variable dialog, while picking an Execute Action node will select the first empty argument. Inspired by feedback from <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/profile/9cj1ygrmat/">Carlos Olías</a>. (RAID-1580)</li>
</ul>
