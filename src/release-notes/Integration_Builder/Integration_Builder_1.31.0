<h3>New in Integration Builder 1.31.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integration Builder now generates a new Server Action to help you to sort data from your external systems. This new Server Action is called ‘Get<object name>BasicOrderById’ and can be found in the DRV module included in integrations generated by Integration Builder. (RCNT-4098)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that was causing an error message "IntegrationBuilderUser role required". This error message was displayed when users clicked action buttons after their session had expired. (RCNT-4444)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was causing an error message "Missing value for mandatory input". The message was displayed when an Integration Builder dependency didn't have the version number in its description. (RCNT-4557)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused errors when generating Microsoft Dataverse or Dynamics 365 integrations during the publishing process.
Breaking change: For Dataverse/Dynamics 365 integrations, the static entities that listed all entity attributes will now only list readable attributes. (RCNT-4580)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented Integration Builder from installing/updating dependencies in some complicated circumstances. Integration Builder would not install needed components automatically when other components needed to be updated. (RCNT-4581)</li>
</ul>
