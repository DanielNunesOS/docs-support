<li><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=75f48471-6193-4149-abf4-29c15e75c1f6">Log Streaming</a> is a new add-on feature that allows leveraging app log data in the OutSystems Cloud. It adopts the OpenTelemetry standard and continuously collects and streams log data to your Application Performance Monitoring (APM) or analytics tools in near real-time. This enables you to explore other monitoring use cases, such as monitoring alerts to detect and solve issues before they impact end-users. (R11OT-735)</li>

<li>Fixed an issue in LifeTime's checklist. The Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64) is now included in the installation requirements. (RPM-4399) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Platform Installation Checklist</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented users from seeing the full application name or user roles' name on some LifeTime screens. This issue occurred when the name was too long and would be concatenated and displayed with an ellipsis. Now, the space for these attributes has been increased, allowing for full visibility.
