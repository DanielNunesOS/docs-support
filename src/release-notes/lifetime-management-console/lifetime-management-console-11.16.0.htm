<h3 id="new_in_lifetime_management_console_11.16.0" >New in LifeTime Management Console 11.16.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can now use the Environment Filters feature to filter your Application Details with the Environments you are working on. (R11CT-1632)</li>
<li>Updated the Platform Server version to 11.18.0. (R11CT-1638)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.16.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue on synchronization that could delay the synchronization processes to start when running on Oracle database. (R11CT-1652)</li>
<li>[Impact] Fixed an issue during a deployment plan validation when the application tag has been already used in previous aborted deployments. <br>
[Conditions] This issue occurred in deployment plans that contained applications set to be auto tagged and these applications (with the same tag values) had been already used in deployment plans that were aborted before the solution had been published in the target environment. (RPM-3094) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Breaking Change</h3>
<ul>
<li>Breaking change on validating O10 staging plans: when validating a staging plan between O10 environments, if an attribute was removed from a static entity, the validation done by LifeTime will not detect it as a broken reference. To avoid errors, all modules that consume the changed reference should be refreshed and included in the staging.</li>
</ul>
