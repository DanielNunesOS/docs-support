<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.16.3" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an error when refreshing applications in the staging edit screen. This occurred when a user with Change&Deploy permissions in the source environment but lower permissions on the target tried to refresh applications he has permissions to, in the staging plan. Now, the user can refresh the applications. (RPM-3455)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on BootstrapPlugin timer that caused the LifeTime upgrade for PaaS to fail when one or more environments are in maintenance mode. (RPM-3511)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the same environment to have different names. This occurred when the environment name was changed using cloud management tools. Now, the name of the environment should be mirrored in the environments tab and the staging creation. (RPM-679)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the error "OSLTM_LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT with key 0 was not found" to be displayed in a feedback message. This error was appearing randomly but with no impact for the user. (RPM-958)</li>
<li>Fixed cross-site scripting vulnerability. CVSSv3.0 score 5.4 (Medium). (RPM-3636)</li>
</ul>
