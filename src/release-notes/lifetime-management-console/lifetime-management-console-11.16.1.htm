<ul>
<li>Now when adding applications to a deployment plan, a warning icon is displayed to let the user know that the default staging option suggested by LifeTime has a different tag from the one currently published in the source environment. (RPM-947) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.16.1" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a solution publish operation issue where more than one publish request was triggered to the target environment when a timeout occurred in the publish process. (RPM-1525) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the suspension of the synchronization process of the environments which would lead to problems when executing subsequent operations such as deployments, and setting configurations, among others. 
This occurred in infrastructures with multiple applications that weren't deployed in every environment. The suspension was due to too many requests inside the process.
The issue was fixed in an internal query that will avoid the excessive number of requests that led to the suspension. (RPM-2117) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issued that caused MoveData_RequestFact stored procedure to fail on Oracle.
This occurred when old LifeTimeAnalytics tables don't exist, the process was related to an old data migration process that is now removed. (RPM-2869) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the user to be unable to register new environments in LifeTime due to lack of permissions. (RPM-3072) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Added new the auditing logs when the environment security settings are changed. Now each setting has a dedicated audit message indicating what has changed. (RPM-3205) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue with wrong audit message. In a cloud infrastructure, when changing the Maintenance Window of an environment the logged message had the wrong environment name and the user who made the request wasn't recorded. (RPM-3207) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an error when a user had Access permissions in the environment but Change&Deploy in a specific Application.<br/> 
This occurred when LifeTime would add a dependency of that app that the user has no permission to deploy.<br/>
Now, the user will get an exception saying that he does not have permission to deploy one or more of the added dependencies. (RPM-672) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
</ul>
