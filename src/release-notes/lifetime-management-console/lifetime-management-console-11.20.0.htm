<h3 id="new_in_lifetime_management_console_11.20.0" >New in LifeTime Management Console 11.20.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Platform Server version updated to 11.24.0. (R11CT-2671)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Applications that make use of <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=dc811245-bcef-4579-bcee-3530a997eecd">secret site properties</a> and were staged to an environment with LifeTime version 11.20.0 or lower will have "Unable to decrypt content" runtime errors when accessing the secret site property value. The issue will be solved in LifeTime version 11.20.1. 
It's possible to mitigate the issue by going to Service Center and defining the proper Effective value for the secret site property. Please note this is a temporary measure and won't prevent the problem from resurfacing. It's therefore important to upgrade LifeTime to 11.20.1 (the minimal version that has support for secret site properties) or higher as soon as possible to prevent the issue from happening again.</li>
